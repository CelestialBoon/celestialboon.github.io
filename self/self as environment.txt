SELF AS ENVIRONMENT
I've already approached the notion that the Self really is something much vaster and more diversified and articolate than what the pretense of ego would want to paint things as. 

This is a distortion of thought that covers up similar truths as well; for example, the human body-system is far from being a single organism; not only it is a mass of centrally organized single cells, but it also contains a staggering amount of bacteria, virus and fungi - [which collectively outweigh the 'human' cells, never mind outnumber](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-43674270). *We are an ecosystem*—a complex and beautiful cohabitation of living beings, which all together create a dynamically stable, grander whole.

The exact same applies for the individual psyche! Looking inside the mere shell of the individual, one can similarly find a vast and diversified mental environment, a veritable ecosystem of thoughts, routines, personalities, presences, emotions, desires, impulses, wants and needs. All of which contribute to form an organic whole, but which is horrifyingly reductive to consider a single being.

There are very obvious cases in which this inner multiplicity comes to surface—from the more medical cases such as Dissociative Identity Disorder, to the more benign such as tulpamancing, or just talking with yourself as if two people were conversing, or just roleplaying as another character, or even merely playing out scenes in your head, for are not all the actors in there part of your own psychic landscape?

Think about it: if it's someone that you can act out in your imagination, then it's someone who effectively lives inside the vast environment of your psyche. There's **a lot** of stuff in there, if you think about it for two seconds. It's a really, really vast place, even if it feels very small sometimes.

It's powerful and detailed enough that realistic-quality scenes play out within it at least every night. It's a big place, and many things are going on in it at the same time, if at different speeds, as is the way of Nature.

## Is the environment me?

So if there's this vast theater of the mind going on, *are we it*? How does that work?

> E: "Will you therefore confuse yourself with a tree or animal, because you look at them and because you exist with them in one and the same world? Must you be your thoughts, because you are in the world of your thoughts? But your thoughts are just as much outside your self as trees and animals are outside your body."  
> I: "I understand. My thought world was for me more word than world. I thought of my thought world: it is I."  
> E: "Do you say to your human world and every being outside of you: you are I?"
- Jung, Red Book

It feels natural to say that I'm not exactly a bacterium that lives in my small intestine; it is nonetheless *part of my system*; it contributes to the functioning of the whole, and cannot be meaningfully separated from it without altering the whole. In this sense it is also me, much like a cell of my liver is me. As much as there's a 'me', or at least a sense of 'me', this bacterium is both me and not me, in very obvious ways. 

The same can be said for the components of our psyche; they can be observed from the outside, and they can be disidentified with; nonetheless, they remain the participants of our inner life, and without any of those, there would be no inner life, just like no ecosystem would exist if you remove all living beings in it one by one.  
So in the same way as before, all those thoughts, feelings, emotions, desires, are not me; I can realize that I'm something else from them; but they are also an essential part of the experience of 'me'.

So all things said, this doesn't leave us with something very actionable, so it's time to apply a metaphor, a model that would allow us to meaningfully untangle the concepts and positively interact with the system. And as always, *as within, so without*, so the first obvious parallel is with the ecosystems that exist outside of ourselves, be it natural or social.

an ecosystem is an assortment of diversified living beings, which exist in a profoundly interweaved tapestry of relations, and are in fact dependent upon one another in order to sustain their own existence and that of the greater organism. The functioning of a unit is inseperable from its environment, and thus all the other beings that surround its life.

Aside from exceptional cases, a system is necessarily in some form of equilibrium, most often dynamic (by the sheer notion that unstable systems don't stay that way for long; statistically, most systems existing right now have to be self-perpetuating ones on some level, since the shorter they live, the smaller the impact they leave on statistical observation). And in such an equilibrium, each part's functioning, perpetuation and lifestyle are dependant on the whole to provide the context in which to exist and that provides both nurturance and challenges, which also function as means of regulation. 

Each system's equilibrium is personalized, and dependant upon all the parts that particpate into it; as disturbing factors upset the existing equilibrium, it will either reassert itself by excluding the disturbing factor, or it will have to stabilize into a new, different equilibrium that includes the presence and participation of the new factor. The more resilient to destabilization a system is, the more self-perpetuating it is (since for a system to adapt would mean to change, and thus it's not the same system which is passed down in time). In this sense, resilience to change is a positive trait for systems, in that it effectively allows them to stretch themselves in time despite disturbances.

The only real criteria for the existence of such an ecosystem is that it is self-perpetuating; no other factor need be considered. It is, for example, possible for a situation to be extremely dysfunctional and still exist for prolonged periods of time, as long as this system self-perpetuates. (see: poorer ecosystems such as deserts and drylands; abusive relationships; our work system of indentured servitude, etc.)  

Habit is a core mechanism for which this self-perpetuation happens: the repetition of patterns through time and space, wearning grooves into personal and collective memory, both ethereal and physical. Walking paths become trails; survival actions become instincts; acts and beliefs become tradition. Such grooves make the generating act easier, as well as comparatively bringing other actions further from execution (in the same way one is incentivized to walk on a trail rather than wander off in the unpathed woods, or the way a river is very often confined to its bed).

All this is immediately paralleled in the psyche: not only the contents of our inner world are profoundly interdependent on what goes on outside, but the inside is also an ecosystem of its own, which is very prone to habit, is self-perpetuating on several levels, and is also supremely flexible, which allows it to be resistant to severe change (like the classic metaphor of the bamboo cane which bends so that it does not have to break in response to the assault of the winds).

Which leaves us with a substantial connection between our psyche and the natural environment, which would be useful if we would have the first clue about how to treat our natural environment **humanely**.

The parallels of mistreatment of ourselves and of our enviroment are countless.  

nature is not collaborated but rather exploited
having our own ideals in mind, we come in the middle the bare mininum for functioning, and instead impose our own ideas, our own methods, our own structures over the preexisting order of Nature, and as much as Nature goes along with this, it does so reluctantly, and with severe loss of virtue along the way. There is only the strict necessary of attention paid to nature's existing cycles, interrelationships, and subtle workings; instead, all of this is as artifically supplemented as possible in order to satisfy goals such as maximum convenience, mechanization, and market value. All of which make other goals slide into secondary status, such as actually taking care of ourselves by focusing on what gives us the healthiest results, never mind taking care of the environment that feeds us and on which we depend upon. Each year, about 12 million hectares of fertile land are lost to degradation, mostly due to over-exploitation and misuse of the soil.



## What to do

> My thoughts are not my self but exactly like the things of the world, alive and dead. Just as I am not damaged through living in a partly chaotic world, so too I am not damaged if I live in my partly chaotic thought world. Thoughts are natural events that you do not possess, and whose meaning you only imperfectly recognize. Thoughts grow in me like a forest, populated by many different animals. But man is domineering in his thinking, and therefore he kills the pleasure of the forest and that of the wild animals. Man is violent in his desire, and he himself becomes a forest and a forest animal. Just as I have freedom in the world, I also have freedom in my thoughts. Freedom is conditional.

be conscious
your ability to enact change is only possible to the degree of your consciousness about it. 

explore

understand

bring influences



self as this wild environment of all things being you, sometimes even in competition, there's very large presences, and all are you, and it's about taking different points of view on things etc.

active imagination in Jung as means of exploring this wild landscape
that he actually met figures in etc.
plurality as way to explore this landscape and familiarize figures in it

natural farming as the right framework to approach the mind as well
	> As the land gets closer and closer to its original form, the mind of the farmer also finds its way back to its original state.
excellent dispenser of metahpors
trattare il paesaggio mentale in modo naturale. Questo vuol dire

examples of the natives who cultivated the forest in such a careful and elegant way that the colonizers couldn't tell it apart from wild land
the natives have no word for wild, just uncultured, unattended

man has warped the environment in specific ways that become self-perpetuating or accomodating, like the woods of Japan had become dependent on man to caretake for it since that's what man was doing. Which can be an excellent thing! It means man has a place in Nature, but it can quickly be overstepped and especially man can end up taking a lot more on thier shoulders than is strictly necessary (high-maintenance mental space)
to change things it's not only necessary to realize the error (so to stop doing the wrong thing), but also to change things it's often necessary to make reparations and give nature the tools to once again shift to a more self-sustained sort of cycle, which can mean eg. providing the seeds so that nature can sort itself out, or even providing initial help to nurture the new efforts so that they aren't smothered and can grow to adulthood and non-fragile self-reproducing existence

we are the result of the seeds and the treatment that has been sown on your land, and yet, there is something that transcends the mere nurture, there is something outside of the mere events who can intervene and steer and that wants something of this life and that can direct this garden to grow what is pleasing and what works

the figure of man as steward of the land, as the expressor of a Bigger way, the Tao, Nature etc. but doing so with a more direct channel to the Divine, so able to bring a vision in faster terms? 

My experience: introducing the idea of pleasant voice and letting it grow gradually up to a pleasant mind space/room
reparations

dream as place in the mind to visit
self of self dissolving in it because you can be anything in the dream. the Everything is conscious so nothing in itself is. It's a scene exploration and it's freeform
relaxed identification rules, just space of raw experience
