EGO AS SOCIAL HABIT

the ego disappears when in prolonged isolation because the structures that justified it disappeared
adaptation like Nature to external conditions, loops provoked by the system
ego as response to the outside conditions (society) which will disappear if society disappears
and how people act a characters as means of interacting with society. people playing clowns because that's their expectation of their role in society. That's what society rewards them for (with eg. the attention they need and crave) and so that's what they understand their role is
Jeods being the resident sad boy because pity is how he gets attention and that's his internalized expectation from early years
and of course breaking off from it is scary since this satisfies a deep craving to belong, it's the deep push to be a productive part of whatever we're in, it's the innate irresistible need to S E R V E and that's the depths it brings us to
we are so built to serve we mold our identities effortlessly to whatever situation we encounter so as to fit the situation's needs
and so people with enough openness can just become whatever the situation needs, we can just, have divine inspiration and deliver whatever it's necessary. Being an enough open character means you become god because we want to serve things so badly we'll just provide everything. Everything
So jeods is the sad boy because of the way it fits the environment. He'd be a poorer fit if he changed that
so likewise, me being productive and successful would mean for me to be a poorer fit for what I'm living in, which squares out since C&N wouldn't want me to leave, so that leaves this
and instead we have to confront our innate goodness within us and say "look,"
and realize we have better ways to serve, that we can just leave some of them behind, that we don't have to play everyone's games
why does this happen? Because the bodymind's development is stuck at the time when we're expected to absorb everything from parents and environment unquestioningly, undiscerningly, surrenderingly until we absorb enough love to proceed, but that part doesn't happen so we're stuck in the conditions because we still expect that love to be delivered. Like a baby bird eternally mouth open waiting for teh right food to be delivered to its gaping mouth
