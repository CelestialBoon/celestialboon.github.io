Dreams have been bringers of advice, introspection, and messages for time immemorial; they are the theatre of our inner life, and the space in which we can explore vivid realities beyond the physical.

Better yet, it's possible to be conscious enough in dreams to know that they are dreams, so that they can be lived and interacted with from an ordinary consciousness level; we can ask the dream questions, we can have novel or impossible experiences; we can even life different lives in there.

For a basic introduction on how to lucid dream, go read [The Phase](https://obe4u.com/study/practical-guidebook/). A (rather old) [list of other useful sites](dream/2009-11-09-useful-sites-compilation.md) for dreaming is also available (mostly focused on lucid dreaming.)
