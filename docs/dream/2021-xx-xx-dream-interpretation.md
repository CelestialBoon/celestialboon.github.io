> "The dream is the small hidden door in the deepest and most intimate sanctum of the soul, which opens to that primeval cosmic night that was soul long before there was conscious ego and will be soul far beyond what a conscious ego could ever reach." - Carl Jung

It pains me to see dreams relegated to bs like random firings of the brain or cleaning routines, when they can be so much more and *are* so much more for so many people. 

rich in symbols, communications, active someone on the other side who is communicating and reaching out
it is a marvelous theatre of the inner world where things are represented in metaphor and symbol
and it can be profoundly useful to help us understand ourselves at a level both immediate and deep about what goes on inside us, that we so often and carelessly suppress in order to often cope with an outside reality that sometimes ignores, sometimes dismisses, sometimes ridicules, sometimes ostracizes such notions and insights.

It is a rich source for self-understanding and self-development, and increasingly so with commitment, more and more opens up

Let's say we have two sides to ourselves, the rational brain and the emotional brain. In this society, the rational brain is the one we most commonly use when awake, while the emotional part gets relegated to the side, ignored, or oftentimes even outright suppressed to fulfill the demands of either a warped society, or our own distorted understanding of the world.

During sleep, the emotional brain is the dominant part instead, all the more because of the repression it incurs during the day, so that dreams become some of the few precious spaces of free expression it has.

- dreams become avenue of accessing the shadow material, the parts of ourselves that we usually hide during the day because we can't tolerate them, others can't tolerate them, we don't understand them, or they're too much for our acceptable range of experiences. No such restrictions are posed in dreams, and they're a free plaza of expressions of the usually repressed parts

During the day, we navigate the world through logical connections, such as going to the shop to buy a list of things that we need, and we navigate spacetime in a linear manner. The main connections we operate on are logical and spatial

This is not so for dreams! The part at the wheel is the emotional brain, and the meaningful connection by which a dream operates are emotional ones, poetic ones, free-association ones.

it's possible to observe that emotional state changes abruptly with transitions into timespace naturally IWL, such as putting our work mask on when we go to work or suchlike. Emotions are dependent upon spacetime and the flow of information mostly goes spacetime-> emotioons

in dreams, it's the emotion which are continuous and instead it's spacetime which jumps around, accomodating the former instead of the reverse. The flow of information is mostly emotioons -> spacetime, which is why there can be abrupt scene transitions that however keep the narrative/emotional thread intact, or things abruptly show up just because of our expetation to.

Dreams are an intricate dance of symbols, and its thread of continuity is not spacetime itself, but rather the emotional state that evolves through the dream and that is both accompanied and expressed by the dream.

Things and events in dreams provoke associations, connections in our mind, and that causes an emotional reaction, and that is by and large the functioning behind the succession of dream events, especially those involving the unconscious dreamer.

From such a standpoint, the truer reality of the dream symbols is effectively not what they look like, but what they represent, what they associate with; what impression they leave on the dreamer (which is of course a different impression for different people, based on their sensitivities and background). These associations are the key! The metaphorical/symbolic level is of far greater importance than the object level in dreams, both concerning their inner dynamics and their interpretation.

All things in dreams can be (and in fact are) symbols: people, object, places, situations, actions, events, can all be meaningfully interpreted, for each thing is there precisely because of a meaningful association which we possess. 

This works in more ways than one would expect; 

and even just word sounds, or just word play, rocky as with rocks, or turbulent, I've had puns in dreams even, association works in as many ways as it comes

rocky situation with rocks or hard rock

- use free association to find possible links between things, and weave a thread/path through the chain of symbols
- this is also how brains work

- the more you pay attention to dreams, the more dreams start speaking up

## How to remember dreams

Remember that we dream every night! We all have multiple REM phases each night, and they can all be recalled with practice. 

We also wake up naturally multiple times a night (called microawakenings); normally we just go back to sleep right away, but they can be used, with intention, to better capture the dreams that just happened before then

(It's also possible to experience oneself outside of the REM phases, but that's outside the scope of this guide)

- set intention

- make sure you're not woken up by something, and wake up naturally instead

- to remember the dream, remain still, the memory is somatically tied to the position you woke up in, head out in that space, grab even a fragment, and proceed from there. It grows with practice and persistence, the intention allows the whole thing to unfold without thought

- keep a dream jlournal, preferably written down, to stimulate both intention, commitment and the recalling itself (as you put things down you free space for more to come to surfaec)

## How to interpret dreams

the layer that is always present is regarding the self, and seeing all parts of the dream as parts of self
it's the inner theatre manifesting to be observed and lived

- read the dream out loud 2 or 3 times, and get the sense of the symbols, break it into scenarios and scenes, label the scenes

- highlight or circle all the important parts, the imporant symbols, relationships, dynamics

- reading it slowly to move it out of intellectual mode and connect more with the feelings connected with each symbol

it's doable to consult an online dream dictionary if you feel stumped about something; we do share common archetypes to a degree and it's good to find inspiration in what others have made of their symbols

dreams changing as sign of progress








- DREAMS
- impressions and associations
- PTSD, like car accidents make cars become associated with danger, unsafeness -> and in a dream the car would symbolize helplessness and so on
- actions can be symbols ofc
- simultaneous interpretations of symbols and relationships between them
- marion woodman, jungian interpretation woman, died 2018
    - how do you know when you "have the dream"?
    - when the meanings fall apart and come together at the same time
    - integral thinking is a post-rational way of looking at the world, pattern recognition, looking at the whole thing (gestalt? left hemisphere?) as opposed to linear, rational thinking (right hemisphere, analytic)
    - feeling belief

- always imporant to say the interpretation out loud, and follow the trail of strong activated feelings from that, that's your path to the core meanings, dreams by nature contain emotional content and communicate in emotions, so that's what you follow
- ends with a feeling of completeness, that you've got it, the pieces have fallen out and came together in the pattern, you recognize what stuff was a stand-in for, deep sense of knowing, that you got it, maybe even a sense of having to honor the dream IWL by following up on it (even if it's just making it public in an artistic way)
- the more you pay attention the more dreams start collaborating and becoming meaningful
- parts of you that know stuff that the intellect doesn't, that gives you gifts
- integration of intellectual and emotional brains

- process of focusing, focusing on part of body and it generated a dream scene (it has the same characteristic of an actual dream)
- dreams will communicate to you in a language that you know
- different level of conceptual resolution to dream interpretation

- DREAM INTERPRETATION
- tupperware at home, that he had in childhood
- the police woman is his mom, he understood just reading it out the second time and remembering what the pieces were connected to
- it's very important to say feelings out loud because it bypasses the intellectual brain, it gets processed and received by the emotional brain and the feedback loop is tight
- lucidity depends on the sense of self, strong dream can lead people to lose sense of self in the dream, and lose lucidity
- sense of self, identification with feelings
- mindfulness is identification with the witness, which allows to disidentify with the rest and stay aware and not react
- the other way is to just stare at something and disidentify it by recognizing it, and so on until nothing remains to identify with (even through dream interpretation)
- why is a symbol and not another? like both a mouse and a spider are small and hide, but a mouse is cuter etc. also elusive and hard to kill and kind of dangerous 
- mice can smell your jhanas
- clearing out stuff helps with lucidity and awareness and so on
- sample dream
    - a hot rock bright orange and fiery like the sun rolled down the mountain slowly like a snail. It stops under a mulberry tree (safety) and a small child looks and is scared to touch it.
        - the slow moving threat from above 
        - danger from childhood, anger and rage being contained into a play thing
        - the anger coming down the family line, from her mom, but the anger is contained and she played with it, amusing light and colors (amusing for her)
        - he hasn't been angry since childhood, has been punished a lot, resolved not to be angry
        - the mulberry tree is a sort of place of safety
    - becomes glassy smooth lime green marble smelling like a lemon
        - the shrinking threat grows cold
        - they had a lemon tree at home but it never matured and it gave 1-2 lime green immature lemons, immature anger never expressed but always contained
    - soft, moving in hand like a snake when touched. 
        - the soft, rubbery snake
        - when anger is addressed it's scary, uncontrolled, mind of its own, didn't like it
    - Curious what's inside, Smashed against another rock, takes a while, loud sound, explosion, ants crawl out
        - smashing the threat
        - ants is all the ways the anger was leaking out into behaviours and relationships, annoying people all the time, because he's not owning up to the anger
        - passive aggressiveness, sarcasm, ridiculing, making fun of people, putting down
    - I don't have to be afraid of my anger
        - he started crying then, he had to reevaluate his relationship to anger, he's been holding it tight until then, and then the release, he made peace with anger, the spot can let go and relax, the tightness in the belly released
