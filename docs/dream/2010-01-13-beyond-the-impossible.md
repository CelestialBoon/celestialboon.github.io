Rather than an experiment, this is a full-fledged technique that I recently developed. Gotta thank all the dreamers that participated in the “[Mind sets its own limits](https://community.ld4all.com/t/the-mind-sets-its-own-limits-needs-your-contribution/31475)” topic, you helped me a lot!

This exercise will help you to get over any block you might be facing, be it not enough LD’s, or bad dream recall, or lack of particular powers in dreams, you name it. It’s a large-spanning method, and in fact may work with whatever you might want to experiment with. My final words before the actual tech are, hope you enjoy!

First, pick a big goal of yours. One of those you think you’ll maybe reach in a year or two, or in a decade, or maybe in your lifetime. If you don’t have any such big goals, it’s time to create some; and more than one at that: it’s always good to dream (pun intended). It can just be an exaggeration of a present one, it’s up to you.

What I want you to do is, either see yourself, or tell us your story, of striving for an even bigger goal: it can get to the point the exaggeration brings this to purely fictional levels (for example, if you strive for perfect dream recall, your character might be trying to remember multiple dreams at once!), and most importantly, give any previous, required goal for granted, and tell us of how you’re getting to that one instead. 

Narrate us a story, in which you use your powers, get lucid, meet the person you wanted to etc. like it’s something you’ve learned in childhood, like if it’s easy as riding a bike. He/she does already possess what you’re striving for, and is reaching for a lot, lot more. An example would be your character learning to juggle 13 balls when you can barely make it with 4, or learning to do it while walking on a rope. The point is, your goal is necessary for reaching the higher one, and is absolutely taken for granted, like when you’re sure of knowing the alphabet when you’re trying to write a successful book. Thinking big is the key here, just let your desires go wild on this one.

In this story, your character must do some progress towards the (bigger) goal, and keep a positive attitude during the whole experience; but what I care more about is detail.  

The story must be detailed, particularly in the parts (s)he uses the abilities you’re striving for. Describe feelings, sensations, happenings, all you can of those crucial moments, cram in all senses, see things, hear sounds, smell odors, feel textures, and more importantly, make the whole thing realistic to you. I want you to truly believe this is a good way for you (your character) to do that thing, and it doesn’t matter if it’s weird, crazy, or anything, as long as you feel, deep inside, that this one is really a way to go. Remember always it’s not the real you we’re talking about in the story; the character has already mastered what you’re reaching for. However, it is a fictional you, that still thinks, acts, and feels in a way that is true to yourself. They are very important points, remember them.  

So, in order to write the right thing, keep trying until you really feel good about it, without it being stretched, cheesy, or anything, only right. Remember also to have fun during the whole thing it’s not really useful if you’re not enjoying the process. Also, take it easy on you, it’s just a story you’re fantasizing about, so try to avoid linking the story with your present experience. Instead of the perfect day of the present you, think of it as more of a normal day of the new yourself.

When you’re trying to figure out a way to do something, write the *very first* thing that comes to your mind, period. Then analyze it, it is often the right one. If it’s not, feel free to try again 

A useful way would be brainstorming, if you find yourself having problems of any kind.  

Remember that there’s a always a solution: it’s your dreams we’re talking about afterall, and if you can do anything in there, there must be a way to do it; just take time to figure out *your particular way*, and *your reasons to do it*. Don’t do it just because everyone else does, do it for your sense of freedom, of exhilaration, of fun, for your enlightenment, what strikes you the most.

You may feel emotions surfacing when you’re trying to visualize a fitting way to do it: that means you’re on the right track, regardless of the type of those emotions. If it’s joy, peace, or excitement, just let them guide you forward, let them write the story for you; but instead, if it’s discomfort, worry, or even fear what you’re perceiving, then it’s time to go deeper, continue trying, and find out the precise reasons of these feelings. Once you’ve nailed them out, write down the precise moment, or reason, that triggers that emotion, and start working towards a resolution. You know now precisely your problem, and knowing is half of the battle. Try to know the reasons for your fears, accept them, and find an alternative way out, because fears have a valid reasons to exist, and it is guiding you in though situations, but that’s no reason for you to let them limit yourself.

Once you know your fear, you can start working around it. For example, if you strive to fly, you could find you’re afraid of heights; if you dig into it long enough, you could find it’s related to a painful experience that either you or someone close to you had in the past. Now that you know the reason of your fear, it’s finally up to you to decide if this fear is reasonable or not in the single contexts, if it’s right to act out of it or not. Knowing this, you can continue visualizing and writing, until you feel finally satisfacted about it. *Always remember* that’s not the real you that you’re writing or visualizing about, it’s about a future you, that knows/does a lot more than the actual you, and the adventures (s)he undergoes are ordinary to him/her, even if they’re still thrilling and exiting.

After you did it, and the story is completed, you may find you’re feeling good about this: read back/remember the most interesting passages if needed. Now treasure that feeling, for it shall gently guide you to success in the moment of need. You can even anchor it (like Spider described with dream recall, but it can be used for pretty much anything), so it will be always ready for use. That’s all that is needed. Treasure the memory of the adventure if you liked it (and I’m sure you did), but more importantly, treasure the feeling.

If you want to use this as an induction/incubation tech, just wonder in bed about the story, see yourself doing all that great stuff, but be aware of doing it with a hint of detachment (brought by the supposed normality of the events), or the excitement could keep you awake: it the thought can keep you awake, you should avoid saying things like “I’ll do this tonight” or similar, unless you’re going for a regular MILD (with powered-up objectives). Instead, just think nothing of the experience, just keep that happy feeling inside yourself, it is sure enough to tell your SC you want a similar LD ^^ and it’s easier than you may think for the SC to grant your wish.

<u>Tips for visualizing:</u> you can just do it in a daydream and hijack it to your wildest desires, or start visualizing on your own, thinking about a past dream that you’ll become lucid in this time, or just start off a fantasy, (advice: fantasies along the lines of “the average LD of my new self” are better than, say, “my perfect LD”). You can even do it in hypnagogic states, or in meditation, for greater results.

<u>Tips for writing</u>: here are some templates you can use to set up a story:

*Sudden realization*: the protagonist learns how to face a certain problem by stroke of inspiration, maybe aided by words of friends or wise teachers.

*Dream school*: You heard me, an entire school to learn to LD. Describe your days there, the classes, the dialogues, and of course the LD’s, where you put to use what you’ve learned.

*Rewrite with lucidity*: just put the protagonist in a dream you’ve had, make him/her recognize and remember it, and this time go crazy with all the powers (s)he’s acquired so far.

*Help a friend in need*: a friend of yours is in need to learn a certain thing (still one of the big stuff), and you are well above that, and proceed to teach him throughout (option to train him/her in a shared dream).

*Gift of power*: you get a gift from various sources, including a creature/fear you just defeated, your SC, your DG, a friend (maybe in a shared dream), and proceed to try it out. (Include the part where you earn the gift)

*Instrument of power*: Invent, earn, buy, materialize said object that grants you the desired power (preferably something bigger than that) and narrate your adventures with said dream object (possible endings: integration within dream body, “it was you all along” twist).

*Invent*: think of your own story! Use your imagination! You can even take inspiration from some of your dreams to find some good plot.

<u>As a summing-up</u>: dream big people. Dream higher, dream better, dream longer, dream smarter, dream dreamy-er. And enjoy the process.
