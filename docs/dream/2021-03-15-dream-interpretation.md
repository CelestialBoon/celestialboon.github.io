> "The dream is the small hidden door in the deepest and most intimate sanctum of the soul, which opens to that primeval cosmic night that was soul long before there was conscious ego and will be soul far beyond what a conscious ego could ever reach." - Carl Jung

It pains me to see dreams being considered at large to be little more than random firings of the brain or cleaning routines, when they can be so much more, and indeed are so much more for so many people. 

It is a landscape rich in poetry and filled with messages, with communications; it is a marvelous theatre of the inner world, where things are represented in metaphor and symbol.

It can be profoundly useful to help us understand ourselves at a level both immediate and deep about what goes on inside us, a level that we so often and carelessly suppress in order to often cope with an outside reality that sometimes ignores, sometimes dismisses, sometimes ridicules, sometimes ostracizes such notions and insights and expressions.

Dream interpretation is a rich source for self-understanding and self-development, and increasingly so through commitment: the more you pay attention to dreams, the more dreams start speaking up. The more you learn to speak their language, the more they can say to you.

With enough attention spent on it, it's not difficult to start feeling that there's an intelligence on the other side who is communicating and reaching out, in order to get certain messages heard. There are parts of you that know things that the waking intellect doesn't, and that can offer gifts to those open to receive them.

Let's say we have two sides to ourselves, the rational brain and the emotional brain (or for simplicity, the rational side and the emotional side). In this society, the rational brain is the one we most commonly use when awake, while the emotional part gets relegated to the side, ignored, or oftentimes even outright suppressed to fulfill the demands of either a warped society or our own distorted understanding of the world.

During sleep, the emotional brain is the dominant part instead, all the more because of the repression it incurs during the day, so that dreams become some of the few precious spaces of free expression it has.

In such a situation, dreams become an avenue of accessing the shadow material, the parts of ourselves that we usually hide during the day because we can't tolerate them, others can't tolerate them, we don't understand them, or they're too much for our acceptable range of experiences. No such restrictions are posed in dreams, and they're a free plaza of expressions of the usually repressed parts.

During the day, we navigate the world through logical connections, such as going to the shop to buy a list of things that we need, and we navigate spacetime in a linear, continuous manner. The main connections we operate by are logical and spatial.

This is not so for dreams! The part at the wheel is the emotional brain, and the meaningful connections by which a dream operates are emotional ones, poetic ones, free-association ones.

It's possible to observe that emotional state changes abruptly with transitions into timespace naturally while awake, such as when we internally put on our "work face" when we go to work or suchlike. Emotions are largely dependent upon the context of spacetime, and the flow of information mostly goes spacetime -> emotions.

In dreams, what with physical rules being much more relaxed, it's the emotions which provide a continuous thread instead, and it's spacetime which jumps around, bending to accomodate the former instead of the usual reverse. The flow of information is mostly emotions -> spacetime, which is why there can be abrupt scene transitions in order to keep the narrative/emotional thread intact, or why things abruptly show up just because of our expetation to.

Dreams are an intricate dance of symbols, and its thread of continuity is not spacetime itself, but rather the emotional state that evolves through the dream and that is both accompanied and expressed by the dream.

Things and events in dreams provoke associations, connections in our mind, and that causes an emotional reaction, and that is by and large the mechanism behind the succession of dream events, especially those involving the unconscious dreamer.

From such a standpoint, the truer reality of the dream things is effectively not what they look like, but *what they represent*; *what they associate* with*; *what impression they leave on the dreamer*. Those impressions of course will be different for different people, based on their own sensitivities and background, but they are are the key to how the dream functions. The metaphorical/symbolic level is of far greater importance than the object level in dreams, both concerning their inner dynamics and their interpretation.

All things in dreams can be (and in fact are) symbols: people, object, places, situations, actions, events, can all be meaningfully interpreted, for each thing is there precisely because of a meaningful association which we possess which, in a sense, summoned it into being. 

This works in more ways than one would expect; animals might associate to a certain quality they remind us of; certain places can associate with periods of our life, with certain qualities of life, with the place's expectations; people more often signify some traits within ourselves than the corresponding physical people. But there's more: sometimes the associations can happen through word sounds, or just word play, like a an attacking bear might stand for an unBEARable situation, or a a bunch of rough rocks on the path might stand for going through a rocky situation. Puns are absolutely a possible connection in dreams: association there works in as many ways as it comes.

For this reason, it's often important to use free association to find possible links between things, and weave a thread/path through the chain of symbols that the dream offers.

This is also how brains work! We reason by association, by connecting things together, by modeling a thing with another thing, and the dream's workings mostly just shift the predominant associations from logical+spatial to metaphorical+symbolic.

## How to remember dreams

The first thing to remember is that most of everyone dreams every night! With vanishing exceptions, we all have multiple REM phases each night, each containing several dozen minutes' worth of dreams, and they can all be recalled with practice. 

(It's also possible to experience oneself outside of the REM phases, but that's outside the scope of this guide)

We also wake up naturally multiple times a night (called microawakenings); normally we just go back to sleep right away, but they can be used, with intention, to better capture the dreams that just happened before the waking.

**Set intention**: Your intention is crucial to engage during the process. It's what's going to make the difference on wakeup from just doing what you'd usually do to instead stopping to remember and write down what happened. It's often useful to set the intention to remember and write down your dreams just before going to sleep.

**Wake up naturally**: Make sure you're not woken up by something violent (like an alarm), and wake up naturally instead. Alarms are highly disruptive of the wake transition, and dreams can fade fast for some if they get distracted by something when they wake up. Natural light is excellent for waking up gently and with the sunrise, but it's also definitely possible to just set the intention to wake up by yourself at whatever time. You can try it!

**Lay still**: On waking up, to remember the dream it's best to remain still; the dream memories are somatically tied to the position you were sleeping in, so just lay there in the position you woke up in and head out in that inner space, grab even a fragment, and proceed from there. The intention to recall allows the whole thing to unfold without thought.

**Keep a dream journal**, preferably manually written down, to stimulate both intention, commitment and the recalling itself. 

**Practice**: Your ability to recall dreams in detail grows with practice and persistence; it can take some time, but eventually you'll get the knack for it. And remember that as you write things down, you free mental space for more details to come to surface.

## How to interpret dreams

A dream's message often exists on multiple layers of interpretation. Some dream event might refer to your internal state in certain situations, but maybe also to some physical event, about your relationship with someone, etc.

However, most if not all dreams should be interpreted at least on the personal layer. If nothing else, our worldview shapes and colors events, and so this layer will always exist in a dream representation. This means that all parts of the dream, all people and objects and places and events should be thought of as parts of self interacting with one another. The dream is the theatre of the inner life, manifesting it to be observed and lived. For example, traveling can signify an inner search; fighting represents inner turmoil, etc.

- Once you have the dream written down, read it out loud 2 or 3 times, and gradually get the sense of the symbols, break the dream into scenarios and scenes, and possibly label the scenes.

  It's very important to say the interpretation out loud, and to follow the trail of strong activated feelings from that, because that's your path to the core meanings! Dreams by nature contain emotional content and communicate in emotions, so that's what you must follow.

  Giving an out-loud verbal expression to feelings is important because it bypasses the intellectual brain; it allows them to get processed and received by the emotional brain and the feedback loop is kept tight.

- Highlight or circle all the important parts, the imporant symbols, the relationships, the dynamics. Pour over the dream slowly to move it out of intellectual mode and to connect more with the feelings connected with each symbol.

- The process works to bring the subconscious truths of the emotional brain to the light of the rational brain; it is a matter to letting the emotional side of ourselves speak so that it is listened to and understood by the rational side, culminating in an integration of the two sides, and a greater understanding. You'll know you're doing a good job when the interpretation leaves a sense of completeness and satisfaction.

- It's doable to consult an online dream dictionary if you feel stumped about something; we do share common archetypes to a degree, and it's sometimes useful to find inspiration in what others have made of their symbols, but it must be kept in mind that dreams operate at a very personal level, and more important than the symbols themselves is the emotion+feeling thread that they rest upon.

- Sometimes you'll get very vivid dreams that intuitively feel very important. Those are usually called Big Dreams and it's especially important to study those, for they can hold crucial life information. 

- Remember that dreams will communicate to you in a language that you know. In some sense they are made by you, and with practice you can grow to understand and appreciate this language that is used internally by you.
