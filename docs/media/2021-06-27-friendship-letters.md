Season 1 of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic has probably been one of the closest representations of a true utopia that we've managed as of late as a culture. It is an idealized mirror from which to observe, study and evaluate our own world.

Some parts of it can be specifically discussed and analyzed as to why; today I talk about friendship lessons.

A friendship lesson is essentially the content of the letters that Twilight Sparkle, Princess Celestia's faithful student, periodically sends her mentor, recounting her latest discoveries and understanding about the intricacies and the magic of friendship.

This practice, religiously repeated at the end of every story arc, strikes a similarity to other endeavors of ours such as postmortems and retrospectives, as the formal act of reflecting on the past events in order to learn from them.

This sort of behaviour stems from the very human capacity of ours for introspection, to be able to understand what we do at a level abstract enough to figure out, in a feat of inverse kinematics, that we <i>could</i> do something different from what we did in order to get closer to our prefixed goals.  
This is a non-trivial ability, which only humans are seen on Earth as using in extensive capacity (sometimes to a fault). Animals, for example, mostly operate through instinct to a much larger degree, letting themselves be guided by the voice of their species, and not thinking too much about it.

There is something profoundly tied to the human condition here, in this ability of ours that sets us markedly apart from other earthly lifeforms, for good and for bad. It allows us vastly accelerated learning curves, at an epigenetic level, but it can also torment us with excessive self-consciousness, wild extrapolation, and all sorts of misunderstandings about reality that we end up piling on top of the actual Thing.

This facet of our life experience is most properly elaborated in the <i>Gnostic theory of error</i>, which posit that the human capacity for self-reflection allows us to learn from our mistakes as a main mode of operation; that is, as people, we primarily learn by doing things and correcting the mistakes we find ourselves doing on the way. This is the concept behind learning through practical exercises, and "hands-on learning" such as apprenticeship, and even the "fail fast" startup philosophy. All of these are founded on the concept that *doing is at the foundation of learning*, since by doing we create the preconditions to self-reflect, and thus to learn through correction.

However, correction of mistakes is not a given, and it is possible for errors to go either unremarked or uncorrected. Given the nature of errors, they do not disappear unless corrected, and often they can instead balloon in size and spiral in perversity, in the same way that building on top a shaky structure creates a progressively more unstable and dangerous building. Like a game of Tetris, mistakes pile up and make everything more difficult, until they are addressed and resolved.

It is possible for errors to spin so wildly out of control that they turn into monstrous endeavors, warping the actions and thoughts surrounding them, eventually descending into outright evil, which is the culmination of error. This is clearly depicted in FiM by the greatest evil in S1 - Nightmare Moon - which was simply born out of Luna's failure to process and resolve her feelings of envy towards Celestia.  
To restate this point, even the greatest of evils in S1 Equestria is not some elemental force, but merely the result of somepony's failure to address and correct their (very "human") errors.

> Gnostic error theory states three simple, interlocking truths:  
> (1) humans are creatures who learn by making mistakes;  
> (2) to learn from our mistakes we must detect and correct them [...];  
> and (3) when we fail to detect and correct our mistakes they can extrapolate wildly and spin us beyond human limits.  
>  
> John Lamb Nash - <i>Not in His Image</i>

It can be observed that the majority of episodes of FiM S1 are founded on this very dynamic of error correction: through the actions of the protagonists, some errors of theirs are revealed; these spiral out to some degree until the point of correction, through which the plot is resolved. This very correction becomes the "friendship lesson" du jour, which is then immortalized by a letter written to Princess Celestia.

To give but some examples:  
- In <i>Applebuck Season</i>, Applejack stubbornly refuses to be aided in the apple harvest and works herself to exaustion, to the detriment of her life and her friends', until she corrects this behaviour and allows her friends to help with the work.  
- In <i>Boast Busters</i>, Twilight lets Trixie run rampant in Ponyville until her crafted reputation gets her in big trouble, which Twilight then fixes through the use of the very powers that she refused to boast in order not to upstage Trixie.  
- <i>In Green Isn't Your Color</i>, both Fluttershy and Rarity learn that it's not worth to hide important feelings from their friends, since doing so and trying to keep up appearances got them roped into a situation that both of them resented.

They're pretty much all like that. In fact, the very structure of the friendship lesson is conductive to exactly this process of error correction being front and center of every episode.

Reporting on the learned friendship lessons is a process that Celestia actively demands from her student Twilight. In doing so, she achieves several goals:  
- She indirectly pushes her student to improve herself;  
- She helps Twilight with cementing these lessons in her mind and her life, by making them a very important deal;  
- By requiring transcription into formal letters, she pushes Twilight to really understand the abstract lesson behind the material events;  
- Moreover, she helps Twilight frame her life experience as a learning adventure, injecting meaning and purpose in the student's disparate life events.

As much as a wise mentor figure certainly helps, similar practices can be carried on in our own life: small, contained gestures that nonetheless help us reframe our whole lives under the light they cast. A famous example is gratitude journaling, that trains people into noticing more the things that they are appreciative about. In general, dedicated practice to zero in on our (daily) actions, the errors that we notice in them, and the corrections that were made, or can be made, can be very productive to help us generate and cement learning. 

Most people do not lose the capacity to learn as they grow older; they merely lose the willingness to try new things (that might reveal new errors), and the willingness to address their errors as such, instead believing that it's just "who they are" on some level. What changes is their forma mentis, that eventually doesn't allow them to learn anymore, even if they're perfectly capable of doing just that, like someone might just stop biking one day even if they've never forgotten how.

A saying goes that everything is either a success or a lesson.  

Learning through mistakes has always been in our nature, and those mistakes should not be avoided like the plague (often by choosing to do nothing), but instead faced with as much consciousness as we can muster, so that we can properly understand what to do about them and become better human beings for it, as well as making the world a saner place overall.
