To date, the boom in popularity that My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (MLP:FiM) has experienced in its heyday is one of the most sensational events I've ever witnessed in my life; and part of the reason why that is, I believe, is that Equestria as was depicted in Season 1 was probably as close to an actual depiction of a true utopia as we've recently gotten as a culture. It is an idealized mirror from which to observe, study and evaluate our own world.

There are some specifics of note that can be discussed; today I talk about cutie marks.

In Equestria, every pony is born with a special talent, a certain je-ne-sais-quoi that sets them apart from the rest, mostly an unusual level of potential with certain skills. Going through their early life, a pony eventually "discovers their special talent" through an event that puts their skill on display and earns them their cutie mark, a magically-endowed, permanent butt tattoo which symbolically bears the content of their special talent, and that opens their own personal pathway to contribute something special to society.

As a first point of note, we can see that the appearance of a cutie mark marks a very important transition into pony life, that from childhood to adulthood. An adult pony has discovered their special talent and now knows what it is that they do best in life, and they are thus ready to embark on the second leg of their life journey, that of being able to provide for the community/society that sheltered and nurtured the developing foal.

A cutie mark is an exceedingly convenient stand-in for the human process of initiation, in which a person most often undergoes challenges, trials and tribulations that awaken in them the capacity to face life's difficulties, and the latent potentials in them do best do so. Most spiritually-aware traditions include initiatory rituals, including communal coming-of-age training grounds in which youngsters (usually teenagers) can test themselves, learn very important truths about themselves and the world surrounding them, and ultimately come to enough self-knowledge and skill to be able to contribute to society as an adult. The success of the initiates is of course widely celebrated by the community upon return.

For as much as the initiatory tradition has lost its spiritual edge in Western culture, nonetheless the transition from childhood to adulthood remains a point of enormous and explicitly stated importance, and many vestigial structures remain carrying the left imprint of such transitional rituals, such as the driving test to become able to own/drive a car, or graduation ceremonies in the school system, or even hazing rituals in frat communities. The need to demarcate the short-spanned transition from child to adult is felt very clearly, but it seems that Western solutions about this issue lack substance, and leave many, if not most people feeling like they never really grew up, and are still acting within the "adult world" as extraneous child participants.

Regularly, this lack develops into severe identity crises, like the widespread "midlife crisis" where people regularly find themselves having to deeply question the motives and the life workings that brought them to the point of having a life that they felt compelled to have, but that they do not want, or that does not satisfy their own hunger for purpose, meaning and belonging.

> A crisis of identity and purpose is an inner burning that is rarely extinguished by a visit to a career-planning office, by graduation from a prestigious school, or even by years in a successful career. It is a hollowness, a void that threatens to erase meaning in everything people do. This hollowness is reflected in the attraction of indigenous rituals for many Westerners. A romantic approach to the indigenous world has compelled some seekers to feel profoundly ill at ease about not having experienced a ritual initiation, as their counterparts in the indigenous world have experienced.  
>  
> It is perhaps important to point out that these Westerners may underestimate the depth of their own learning and life experience. Many people would agree that living in the West has its own dangers, which are similar to the dangers to which African youth are exposed during the rituals of initiation. Westerners meet up with tragedy, with powers beyond their control, with challenges that present opportunities for growth and transformation. And these challenges must be recognized as initiatory, even though this initiation is disorganized, unpredictable, and informal, unlike the carefully orchestrated initiatiatory challenge presented to indigenous people. Westerners, like their indigenous counterparts, experience initiation in some form and in a constant manner throughout their life. A person who gets fired at the job faces a life-transforming challenge that can be considered initiatory. A couple facing crisis in their relationship, such as separation or divorce, is on an initiatory path. Initiation is simply a set of challenges presented to an individual so that he or she may grow. Consequently, the troubles we encounter in our paths in the modern world are, in essence, initiatory to the extent that each one of them is life changing.  
>  
> What is lacking in this rich life experience is a community that observes the individual’s growth and certifies that one has passed through an initiatory process. This would not be the kind of certification that gives a person a title in order to pursue a career, but the mere act of seeing and responding, which enables a person, in powerful periods of growth, to behold voices within confirmed by voices from the community without. The issue for Westerners is not so much the absence of initiation as it is the absence of a community to recognize initiatory passages. Tribal life is full of public ritual initiations marking the various stages of a person’s life. From the rituals of birth to the funeral rituals at death, every person’s life journey is clearly highlighted with the milestones of transformational rituals. To the extent that these rituals are challenging and involve hardship, they are comparable to the challenges life presents to individuals in the Western world.

The human reality is that our life in a society requires that the society itself has to reciprocate us; it has to validate our struggles and achievements, something that is distant from most people's priorities, leaving most bereft of a tight-knit community that can provide a nurturing space for meaningful growth.

It is to note, then, that in Equestria cutie marks do away entirely with the necessity for an initiatory experience to be explicitly validated by the community; a cutie mark is not an ambiguous event, nor something that someone can contrast or refute. It's just there one day, visible to all. The validation is innate in the event, which is publicly, implicitly recognized as <i>the</i> coming-of-age rite. Public recognition of one's achievements and adulthood is inbuilt in the social structure, which is naturally organized around cutie marks as a concept.
Nonetheless, it is also true that such a coming of age is also, in some cases, explicitly celebrated by the community for good measure, like with the cute-ceañera in S1E12, "Call of the Cutie".

<hr>

There is, however, a second side to the cutie mark phenomenon. A pony who gets theirs does not just become <i>an</i> adult; instead, they effectively come into a mature version of themselves. They grow into something closer to their true self. There is an important, individualized Something that was latent in themselves (their special talent), and with the appearance of the cutie mark, the pony gains the self-awareness and confidence necessary to bring their own, personal talent to the world.

A pony's special talent often sends many premonitory signs in a foal's life, such as predilections, particular attitudes, or just special interests. Arguably, it is something that accompanies them from birth (if not before), if the mildly-oracular naming practices for newfoals are anything to go by.

Strikingly, this is a point that is also common to many spiritual traditions' view of humanity.

We all know that we need meaning in our lives; we need purpose; we need to serve, in the sense that *we have to serve a purpose*. (Not even nihilists contend this point; most merely question the existence of inherent purpose in human life. But the point wouldn't have been raised if purpose wasn't so important to people in the first place.) People that do not find their own niche in life live adrift in a sea of unconnected and seemingly-random events, without rhyme or reason to their lives, a fleeting sense of identity, and an emptiness inside that gnaws at their bones.

And yet, even as we search for purpose, we are not like the machines we build, which contain a very obvious and visible purpose to their very shape and actions, and that they are mostly bound to; instead, we observably possess free will, the ability to chart the path of our own fate, to make decisions and to defy whatever we consider to be our own destiny. If so, is it then true that we are instead bound to lay adrift in a sea of possibility, without any guidance or true meaning to our life?

Well, not really. The answer many indigenous traditions give, as well as the philosophy of astrology, can be summed up as *predestiny*. We come into this world with an inborn set of potentials, of seeds of talents, that can later be nurtured and grow into powerful skills and contributions to the whole; as pre-incarnated spirits, we also desire to bring these potentials to fruit, and so we arrange for future life opportunities and conditions that will give us the possibility to satisfyingly express said potentials. However, none of this precludes our ability to choose in the moment; at every point in life we remain free to carve the path we desire, even going against the currents of our previous wishes. There are preferential roads set up for us, and periodic reminders, but we remain free to explore and wander, for better or worse.

All of this is contained within a system of rules and structure, some of which are human-made and thus can be played around, and other superhuman ones, comprising the Divine Order, which are much more binding (in the same way we speak of eg. the law of gravity).

> The first demand [of social equality] went against the Pagan notion of astral fate, *hier-marmene*, “the guiding order,” which allotted to each person a definite role in life. The role cannot be changed, because the rules of the game of life are set by superhuman powers. Pagans accepted that life is not fair, privileges are not evenly distributed, and there is no way within human capacity to assure final and complete justice in all instances. Nevertheless, Pagan morality assumed that fair play and decency are possible even in unjust situations. The rules are not set by us, but we can always act in a way that “does not debase humanity and human values.”  
>  
> Honor and honesty were basic Pagan principles that applied to all people in all situations. Slaves and aristocrats alike could act honorably, honestly, and fairly, even though they faced a stacked deck, with inscrutable fate working in favor or against each protagonist. The Pagan virtue of tolerance allowed for a great deal of flexibility in what could be, in some respects, a rigid system of social determinism.

It has to be stated, though, that this system is not intrinsically without social mobility, including when implemented in actual societies; for example there's reports of ancient Mesopotamian cultures using astrology to determine the best station for a citizen, in order to instruct them and direct them towards the ways that they would be most helpful in and suited for. This is, to my understanding, one of the best possible uses for astrology: informing a person of their innate predispositions and talents, and in general helping them come to a greater self-understanding, and offering a personally mythological context in which to frame their life path for the better.

> My people hold dear a view of personhood that contrasts with modern empirical thinking. The Dagara believe that everyone is born with a purpose, and that this purpose must be known in order to ensure an integrated way of living. People ignorant of their purpose are like ships adrift in a hostile sea. They are circling around.

In FiM, upon the momentous realization of a pony's personal talent, a cutie mark appears on their butt as definite, permanent, visually symbolic confirmation of one's true potential.

in FiM such a confirmation is inevitable, solitary, and long-lasting.

Conversely, in humankind such a realization is usually more tentative and more fleeting, and often requires community intervention to stick. In order to participate in a society, the individual needs feedback during their life, particularly the most developmental periods, in order to feel understood, validated, and to better fit the role that they are to take; this includes a landmark-setting for specific achievements in life, for the events that are very testing and that transform us into more mature individuals, which are socially organized in many indigenous communities as initiation rites, and which are instead a very solitary affair for most people in Western/globalized society.

In this sense, with cutie marks FiM embodies a more idealized and streamlined form of our life structure; on both sides of the screen we have individuals with predestinies, but in FiM this is made manifest with ample visual clarity and very little room for misinterpretation, both to the individual <i>and</i> to society (so to leave no room for disagreement), while in a human's life this path is ripe for confusion, missed cues, conflicts with other people and general path-straying. For us people, it is most clear that *it takes a village to raise a child*, because the child needs the guidance, the validation, and the love the village can offer in order to grow into their own innate talents.

Looking at it from this lens, FiM offers a compensation from the recent balkanization and de-spiritualization of human life paths, in that a pony is able to find clear and time-sensitive validation of their talents without the support structure a spiritually-sensitive community can offer.

There is to note that, even in FiM, a pony is not bound to follow their own talents unerringly; they remain free to build the life they choose. However, they do so with the knowledge of where their special talent lies, and what they can contribute most easily for the betterment of the community. Which is to say, ponies remain a close metaphor for humans, possessing free will alongside their (most obvious) predestinies. It is, however, also true that a pony's predestiny is a very consensually accepted notion, and a pony community is most eager to make space for somepony wishing to contribute their talents to society.

Conversely, it is not only more difficult for a human being to have a knowing glimpse into where their talents lay, but it is also vastly more difficult to hold on to the realization, between the distractions of life and the swimming against the current that has to be undertaken in order to fight against the cultural box of a respectable, high-wage corporate job life-path that everyone else would wish of you. Many people have to actively fight to keep doing what they love, what they're good at, what they came here for; fight to practice it and to nurture it. Precious few do so with the blessings of their community; a tragically large portion of humanity currently rides to the grave without having expressed their potentials to their satisfaction, having instead bent to the yoke of society to serve someone else's goals. Many of them didn't even have the realization of what they're good at, or didn't hold on to it for long.

> My sense is that the West's need for healing is rooted in crises of personal identity and purpose. Whether they are raised in indigenous or modern culture, there are two things that people crave: the full realization of their innate gifts, and to have these gifts approved, acknowledged, and confirmed. There are countless people in the West whose efforts are sadly wasted because they have no means of expressing their unique genius. In the psyches of such people there is an inner power and authority that fails to shine because the world around them is blind to it.  
>  
> This implies that our own inner authority needs the fuel of external recognition to inspire us to fulfill our life's purpose, and until this happens, we wait in paralysis for the redemptive social response that rescues us from the dungeon of anonymity. Our own confirmation or acknowledgement of ourselves is not enough. The need to be acknowledged by the society is so primal that if it does not happen in the village, town, or neighborhood, people will go out searching for it.

Our realizations about our purpose, our talents, our life path, are like a fire that has to be kept alive, fed and nurtured. The most obvious way to do so is to embody our purpose, to practice our talents. Though of course, in many cases this is not sufficient for full realization, which is why this post is a call for community and ritual; a call for embracing the need we have to be authentic to someone, to be open and vulnerable for someone, and to receive knowing validation in turn; a call to recognize that we all have gifts laying within us, seeds waiting to sprout and grow; a call to recognize in others what constitutes growing experiences for them, and to point them out so that they will not feel alone in the struggle; a call to celebrate one another's talents and to spur them on, for it is through the realization that we mean something to others that we derive our own purpose; a call to recognize that we do need one another, even if it's just a handful of sane people surrounded by a sea of madness. A few good ones, and the means to keep the community healthy and functioning (which is ritual, as described in [The Healing Wisdom of Africa](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/343584.The_Healing_Wisdom_of_Africa)) is just what it takes.
