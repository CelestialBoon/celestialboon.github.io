It is a fairly shared sentiment that the main series pokémon (MSP) games have been on a downward slope for a while, specifically with the last 3 of 8 generations (SM, XY, SwSh), and I feel that by now a lot of people have come out to denounce this AND have nailed the actual issues with the series to a significant degree.

Among the wealth of other slights:

- The transition from 2D to 3D has been lacking, and the *increase in potential* for detail has not been compensated with an *actual increase in detail*, in fleshing-out of things, so now places feel empty, pokémon feel stiff, and the world makes less sense because less is left to the player's imagination without adequate compensation in actual depiction.

- The formula is getting very stale, AND getting worse every release with more focus being put in the wrong places, like overemphasizing story to the detriment of gameplay, when historically most pokémon storylines have been barely good enough to serve as a pretext for the adventure.

- The decision to target the game to kids "who don't have much time to play our games" is not only baffling and honestly a bit moronic (why are you targeting your game to people who buy it without wanting to actually play it?), but it is also misguided since game directors everywhere seem to mysteriously forget that kids are actually pretty fucking smart and determined to figure out stuff once engaged.

- The overall polish of MSP games is notably decreasing, owing to severe fatigue on Game Freak's side due to the grueling release schedule, poor management, and all the OTHER questionable franchise decisions.

That said, there's another, severely crucial problem which manifests in a variety of ways (decrease in difficulty, babying the player throughout, linearization of routes and progression), all stemming from a core concept that has completely eluded Game Freak's attempts at determining the core appeal of the franchise, instead leaving them clinging to the crystallized story structure of "the prepubescent small-town trainer getting 1 of 3 elemental starters and climbing through the Pokémon League while catching mons and dumpstering a rival and some evil team along the way"; a structure which by now is but a hollow shell of its former self.

The core appeal of pokémon was never about this formula—all the successful spin-offs can attest to that. Instead, the good pokémon games, at their core, are about a story of self-discovery, self-nurturance, self-development and self-realization.

This, of course, happens through the pokémon themselves.

In any game, the protagonist is far more important than just a player avatar; they are an extension of the player self, and an integral part of a player's identity while the game is involved.

The player-controlled trainer of the MSP game, however, is a mute, blank-slate non-entity, barely a transparent proxy for the player to interact with pokémon and their world, and a vehicle for her pokémon collection to get from one place to another, battle, and expand. *The main trainer is not the protagonist of any MSP game*.

Instead, *it is the pokémon team of the main trainer which is the real protagonist*.

Every trainer in the games has a pokémon team that reflects their personality, but for the blank-slate protagonist (lacking another way for it to be expressed) the pokémon team IS her personality, writ large and manifested in physicality; each pokémon serving as a materialized aspect of the psyche, through which she defines herself and, in turn, the player.

Every meaningful act that the trainer accomplishes in the world is through her pokémon, from getting around, to making a name for herself, to saving the world.
Her pokémon are her main means of interacting with the world, which is what a personality is, in fact, about.

With this formula, the player gets to progressively build for themselves (and take care of) a meaningful alter-ego through pokémon catching, training and battling, and to evolve it through having to keep up with the increasing demands in proficiency and efficiency from the game. Many people who played the older gens will remember what a feelings-laden decision it often was to swap team members out for some newcomers; it felt like (and it was effectively a meaningful metaphor for) swapping parts of ourselves in and out.

The pokémon team is THE set of meaningful points of choice and effort-investment of the player, their main avenue to creatively express themselves when faced with adequate challenges that put their creative potential under productive constraints.

Except these challenges have been less than adequate as of late. Gone are the days of Brock and Misty, of Whitney's Miltank, of Red atop Mt. Silver, of Cynthia, of the Zubat Caves and of all the substantial roadblocks that put the pressure on the player to figure out and implement the right way to proceed, instead of mindlessly strolling through the game walking forward and spamming one move, and letting the (now mandatory) EXP-share take care of making your team fully ready to steamroll whoever.

No real challenge is posed to the player anymore, either inside or outside of pokémon battles. Appropriately, it's also started showing in the storyline, where the main trainer is less and less an active participant to the "adult business" of actually progressing the story outside of gym laddering.

It is the tension of being personally put under question, and having to muster the courage to figure things out and to change, that engages us emotionally and that brings satisfaction and lasting memories of accomplishment.

Without any stakes that are perceived by the player as significant—by their ability to put the onus on the player to evolve—the story feels empty of meaningful tension. The emotional engagement flatlines, and the experience becomes bland and forgettable.

The main trainer of the latest installments is effectively a Mary Sue, given the severe power discrepancy between herself and the challenges she faces—maybe except for the part where she's infantilized by basically everyone in the storyline, but it's not like she ever tells anyone off or anything. If she fought to break out of that mold, that WOULD make for an interesting conflict and engaging storyline, but it is never addressed, remaining a non-issue wrt the story. As it stands, it's just insult added on top of the injury.

This whole deal with trying to make the franchise as "accessible" as possible isn't only demeaning of the audience (who needs to know what pokémon ARE this day and age?), but it also runs counter to the very essence of what makes pokémon appealing as a vessel of the player's self. Easier doesn't always mean better—how many games do you know have a "win instantly" button?

Players don't want to be taken on a boat ride; they want an adventure, just like readers ask for a storyline with stakes and conflict out of a novel. No Hero's Journey could ever happen without those.

Growth can only happen under strain, just like muscles need to be torn in numerous micro-tearings to grow bigger and stronger (which is where the phrasing "getting ripped" comes from). In the absence of destabilizing factors thrown the player's way, no meaningful growth is necessary and thus doesn't happen, by sheer economy of action.

This is why there's such a desperate market for difficulty mods in Pokémon games, and why nuzlocke mode is so wildly popular and powerful. It raises the stakes tremendously, and puts the very identity of the player avatar in question with every battle (since the team could get a new hole punched in at each opponent move), all of which is lived very personally because again, the real protagonist of the MSP game is the pokémon team.

With such a ruleset, it's much easier to experience struggle and tension on the path, which is a fundamental component of a good story. It provides a much more functional framework for the player to experience a rugged tale of self-affirmation through artfully dealing with the good (pokémon catches) and the bad (KOs) on the way.

And it's great that it's hard, because self-development is hard work, and any pushovers or unearned gifts on that path (like say, a Mega Lucario out of nowhere) only serve to strain this precious, crucial metaphor.
