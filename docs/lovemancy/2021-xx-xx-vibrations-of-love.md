number 7, of the spiritual seeking, of the subtle magic, and of inner search and evolution
Almost by sheer necessity the various great structures of nature that support our existence that resonate with a particular number are connected and related
and we'll be seeing just how much, since one can build a framework of better understanding by connecting and cross-referencing various structures, building a more solid and meaningful whole.

Inevitably the number 7 is related to the concept of the octave.
(Octave, music, logarithmic hearing, and octave sight)
(octave as same but different)

Scale as self-contained journey, but also toolbox of much greater potential when used non-linearly, and so it is with the seven steps, or layers, or notes of Love

## The sources

They will be inspected from a variety of angles, mostly from four major sources: WMM, Lo1, GT and the chakras

(Lo1)
The Ra Material, is a collection of channeled philosophical discourses centering on the reality and properties of the Universe, of the Earth, and of the Self. It is also called the Law of One material, since the biggest and most consequential lesson in there is exactly that, that all things in existence are One. The Ra Material is widely reputed to be among the profoundest and most reputable sources of understanding for those on a spiritual search. Of particular focus here will be the material concerning the seven main densities, or dimensions, that comprise our current octave of experience.
> some more stuff about the Logos ?

parallel in the body to the existence journey
somewhat contained in the Lo1 as well

(WMM) also mentioning it's somewhat of a special case, but not that much
definitely talking about Love here

(GT)
Often called an *experience* more than a game, *Golden Treasure: The Great Green* is nonetheless on its surface an adventure video game where you live a dragon's life, or lives, right from inside the egg to what awaits beyond.
It stands as an exceptional container of spiritual truths, either lived, shown by example, or outright told. The whole game oozes with an amount of not just *care*, but *mastery*, on such topics that I have honestly never found anywhere else in the video game art form. 
The Golden Treasure parts in the article are mostly aimed at those who have already played through the game, so many things will be left implied; the content will spoilers large portions of the game, and is therefore put within spoiler tags. For those who have not played it yet, I implore you to at least consider doing so: it is the closest I can think of to an _unmissable_ game for a spiritual seeker. It delivers like few other things I've witnessed, the majority of which are also cited in this article.

## Actually talking about the various layers

1
Survival is the first lesson of life, for life needs to self-sustain to continue existing, for some definition of *self*, as opposed to dissolving back into the whole. Life in the earliest stages is the start of the process of individuation, like a bacteria becomes something identifiable as in some sense *different* from the ocean surrounding it, recognizable as such, and in some way more *alive* than the surrounding particles, containing within it a delicate order that needs to be preserved against the buffeting forces of existence. 

Survival is the maintenance of life through one's existence, and valor is the broader virtue of preserving the qualities of existence deemed worth to; those reflecting some sort of higher order, that could otherwise be compromised and dissolve. The sustenance of life, the maintenance of health, and the defense of love are all acts of valor.

just keep talking here, it's your show

(Lo1)

(chakra)
The **root chakra** (associated with the color red) sits at the base of the spine and is associated with security, base physical health, survival, groundedness, and physical action; that is, with the baseline behaviours, properties and qualities of life.

(Wingmakers)
> While valor is generally used in the context of war or the battlefield, it is, as an element of love, linked with the act of speaking truth to power, especially when an injustice is committed. It is common in today’s social order to pretend ignorance of the injustices of our world. Self-absorption in one’s own world is a key threat that undermines the expression of valor, and fear of consequence is the other.
> Individuals who fear consequence in pointing out an injustice misunderstand the co-creative force of First Source. When you operate as a co-creator, you are ever vigilant to the incremental or sudden onset of injustice, and when it occurs in your life path, it must be identified for what it is and dealt with. Valor is the aspect of your love that defends its presence in the face of injustice as measured in the social order. If you don’t defend your virtues—or those too weak to defend their own—you have separated from them and have lost an opportunity to be a co-creative force in the world of form.
> This doesn’t necessarily mean that you must become an activist or advocate for a list of social causes. It simply requires that you defend yourself from injustice. Children in particular require this protection. When I was only about seven years old I vividly remember going to a store with my father and while we were walking in from the parking lot we noticed a mother quite literally beating her child in the backseat of her car. It was a busy Saturday and there were many people in the parking lot, but it was my father who approached the woman and asked her to stop. His voice was firm from his conviction and the woman immediately stopped.
> This was an act of valor because there was no real judgment associated with it; it was simply an injustice that required intervention in the moment. Compassion for both the child and the mother were present in my father, and I believe the mother knew this. This is an example of how the virtues of the heart seldom appear in isolation, but rather as an ensemble that braid themselves for strength and potency for a given situation.

The second chakra is the sacral plexus, which relates to the more instinctual ways of relating to the world beyond survival, such as sexuality, desire, pleasure, and creativity.

(Wingmakers)
> At the subtle levels, this virtue is focused on a specific awareness that First Source surrounds our fellow beings as a field of consciousness and that this consciousness unifies us. If we are unified, it follows that we operate as a collective consciousness at some deeper level, and in this place, we share a common purpose that is richly textured, supremely vital, and yet mysterious, dynamic and uncertain. This awareness, or even belief, shifts our focus from the small details of our personal life to the vision of our purpose as a species.
> At a more practical level, appreciation expresses itself in the small gestures of gratitude that support relationship loyalty and bonding. The deeper levels of appreciation make the relatively surface level expressions genuine because they stem from the frequencies of soul instead of the motives of the ego or mind.

- solar plexus is place of emotions, of self, of fire, of self-confidence, of personal power, of asssertiveness and activity and getting things done, and relationship with others and especially setting boundaries, it's effective relation with other by establishing a strong self, which inevitably is done by relating with other selves; it's the caretaking of our own garden, it's self-esteem and self-empowerment, and of more complex emotions such as purpose, pride, drive, self-confidence, and social rapport/games.
    - and it's perfectly reasonable that these lessons are central to present life, being of 3rd density. The 3rd density lessons are the most common, immediate and obvious in a 3rd density realm/life experience

(chakra)
The Heart chakra is the one most associated with the word Love, for how huge the meaning-space of such a word is. More precisely, it is related to compassion, deep connection, inner peace, acceptance, and self-acceptance.

(Wingmakers)
> Many teachers have spoken eloquently about compassion as the deep awareness of the suffering of another coupled to the desire to relieve that suffering. In the context of the new intelligence that is seating itself on our planet, compassion is an active desire to assist others to align with the new fields of intelligence that are manifesting in the three-dimensional world, aware that their desire and ability to align is distorted by their social enculturation; it does not accurately reflect their intelligence, spiritual inclinations, or purpose.
> The planet we live on is an intelligence unto itself. It is both physical and has very high frequency energetic structures just as we do. It is shifting from the third dimension to the higher fourth dimension and it has been planning this before humanity was even seeded on the planet. It is part of the evolutionary cycle of planetary systems to transmute accumulated densities from one dimension before passing into a higher dimensional grid.
> Compassion therefore is extended to both our fellow beings and the planet itself with the realization that we are part of one another’s destiny if only for a single lifetime. Planet and person dance in the ascending currents of First Source in a collaborative process of regeneration and renewal. We are all part of the mysterious overtures and energetic transcendence that is occurring between earth and the universe, and as earth transforms its accumulated densities each of us will be challenged to transform our own or become further embedded in our fears and emotional turmoil.
> We are privileged to be part of the ascending planetary structure of earth’s nurturing spirit and universe importance. There is now present on earth an amazing diversity of cosmic beings sheathed in human instruments, but hailing from incredibly diverse sectors of the cosmos. We are here to witness and support this transcendence of earth over the densities and entrainment of the three-dimensional intelligence and its artifacts. We are here to accelerate our spiritual growth in an order of magnitude seldom achieved elsewhere in the multiverse. This is a gift of the earth to those present on the planet at this time, and, in some small measure, the motive for our compassion.

The throat chakra is strongly related to truth (especially in the sense of __personal__ truth), and to sharing said truth (free expression, communication)

(Wingmakers)
- The world of form, just as the formless worlds, is composed of energetic structures beneath its denser expression. In a real sense, everything in the multiverse is energy with incalculably long, energy-based lifespans. Energy is transformational; that is, it can alter, or shift into other states of being or, in the case of humans, consciousness. The human energetic structure is often described as the chakra system or electromagnetic body, but it is more than these components. The energetic structure is a form of light, which in turn is a texture of divine love.
- It is a fact that we are composed of love at our core structure, and it is this love frequency that is the basis of our immortal consciousness, or soul. All the lower densities are shadows of this light and operate in time and space, which provide a sheath of density and separation from this core love frequency. The worlds of time and space alter, or dilute this connection we feel to the core energetic structure we all are composed of.
- Herein is the paradox of being human: our innermost structure is divine love and our outermost structure is a means of experience for the innermost structure, but we have become entrained by the outer vehicle to the degree where we identify with it more than the occupant—our true self—inside.
- All of us feel this dissociation with our true self and over-identification with our vehicle (human instrument); perhaps only in degree is there any difference among us. Understanding is the aspect of heart intelligence that recognizes that this dissociation from the love frequency is a necessary design component of the larger blueprint that is occurring on the planet. In other words, it is not that humanity has fallen from grace or is tilted irrevocably toward sin. Rather, we have simply accepted the picture of reality that is dominant, and its dominance is not by accident, but by the designs of First Source.
- There is a well-known phrase within Lyricus that roughly translated says: “The elegance of time is that it unravels the structures of space that have sealed love from itself.” The structures of space, in this case, refer to the human instrument. Only time can break down the rigid barriers, or subtle membranes that prevent or diminish the love frequency from exerting its wisdom in the behaviors of the individual.
- If time is the variable of importance, it stands to reason that everyone is on his or her way to this realization; it is simply a matter of time before they achieve it. Thus, time is the differential that separates us. In a sense, we are all time shifted from one another. No one operates in exactly the same time relative to unsealing his or her love frequency from the world of form.
- Realizing this helps you to understand the relation of unity to reality, and in this realization you are able to accelerate time for yourself and for those with whom your life touches. It is the true purpose and noble definition of time travel.

(chakra)
the third eye chakra is connected to the greater point of view, that of something vaster and beyond the physical self (eg. the Higher Self), and to the powers connected to this expanded perspective (insight, big-picture thinking, having "vision", intuition, psychic powers, etc.)

(Wingmakers)
- Forgiveness operates out of the construct that each of us is doing the best we can under the circumstances of our life experience and the degree that our love frequency saturates our human instrument. When a person operates from the heart virtues and the rich textures of its authentic frequencies, forgiveness is a natural state of acceptance.
- When a perceived injustice enters our experience—no matter how significant or whether we perceive ourselves to be the cause or the effect—we may initially react with the sharp emotions of victimhood or annoyance, but this emotional clutter and distortion can be quickly transformed by experiencing—understanding –> compassion –> forgiveness –> appreciation. This is the equation that transforms the murky turbulence of victimhood or co-reaction into the crucible of light, leaving behind only the purest frequency of love stripped of all purpose.
- Forgiveness is really the outward expression of understanding and compassion without the heavy sentiments of duality (i.e., good and bad) that typically introduce the presence of judgment. It is a neutral expression without design or purpose other than to release yourself from the clutches of time, which is similar to energetic quicksand, entangling you energetically to a time-based emotional state.

(Lo1)

(chakra)
for all of Reality being Divine, the Crown chakra is the one described as the one most resonant with the Divine, or more precisely, with the Beyond. It is the entry point of the cosmic energies into the body, the centerpiece of commonly-defined spirituality, and the nexus of transcendence of Self.


(Wingmakers)
- The soul expresses the love frequency derived from First Source. Its most important purpose, while embodied within the human instrument, is to circulate this delicate, sublime frequency of love to the human instrument. It will come as no surprise that it finds the heart a more willing collaborator than the mind. Humility is the realization that the heart, mind, and soul co-mingle in the grace of First Source. That their very existence is upheld through the dispensation of love from First Source just as surely as a tree is sustained by sunlight.
- In the religious, psychological, and philosophical materials of our planet there is great consideration given to the mind. As a man thinketh so is he. At a more granular level, many people believe that what they think causes their feelings, which in turn creates their vibratory rate and this vibratory rate attracts their life experience. So, applying this logic, the way to attract good things into our life is to think rightly, lest we attract evil or hardship.
- Humility understands that the being that represents you—your fullest identity—is not constituted as a chain reaction of the mind. Rather, it is the presence of love embodied in human form, and this love expresses itself in the virtues of the heart, the pure intellect of the contemplative mind, and the co-creative pursuits of the heart, mind, and soul. Humility is the expression of this love frequency knowing it derives from what already exists in a higher dimension, and in this dimension love is not a thing of sentiment and emotional heaviness. It is a liberating force that acts according to the archetype of First Source: All is one. All is equal. All is divine. All is immortal.
