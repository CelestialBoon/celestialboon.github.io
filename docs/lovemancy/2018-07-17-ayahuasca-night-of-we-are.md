Mother Ayahuasca has gotter her roots very deep into me. I could feel it both journeys, as she radicated herself, made herself part of my very being as she was transiting through the intestines halfway through the experience. She's become undeniably a presence in my life, and even if most times I'm affected at a subconscious level, there's plenty of communication going on at the conscious level. Laughter is often involved; as they say, it's the best medicine.

Though sometimes there's the need for something inbetween. <!-- more -->

So it's been a night conversing with Mother Ayahuasca, in a sense. There's been a definite push ever since the second time I've journeyed with her; there's been times coming back into that place of nonduality, of interconnectedness; of consciousnesses coming together and interacting basically as One. Hitting me when I would watch a documentary or video on ayahuasca, or when I would send some Love directed at my soul, or in specific dreams like when I got explicit permission to come from that place of interconnectedness as much as I liked. To take on that state of consciousness, of being, as just part of what goes on.

I was leaning on the bedroom windowsill last night, staring at the stars above, as thunder flashed repeatedly and silently in the distance, and was wondering about the expressions of appreciation in the life, the ways in which it is expressed and shared; and she commented that gratitude is a natural state of existence. In every moment we create the universe, and what about that is not beautiful? The very world that we create that contains, that expresses, that lives and breathes Love. At the basest of levels, our very existence is an act of Love. A divine gift that we donate endlessly to the world.

It was even stressed during my second journey, that we remind ourselves, again and again, of this beauty, of this purity, of this undefinable Love that composes all layers of the composite. Again and again we show it to ourselves, in all forms; not hiding, and not even pretending to hide; just the bare showing, so that we grow to understand more and more layers of it, of the infinite dance.

Last night has been spent in dreams of bare concepts, clarifying the **WE ARE**. The interconnectedness that we share at the deepest level. On how we can basically think together, much like one would find oneself in sync with one another's thoughts when a team is on a roll; how would soneone complete one another's thoughts and everyone would build on one another in cocreation, to the point of seeming a single mind of multiplied intelligence.  

The Mind of Many. The Genetic Mind as it's sometimes called, or the collective unconscious. We are always connected to it; it is part of us, effectively. My first journey was very distinctively about me getting acquainted with it; I got a very clear look at it first thing into the journeying. A being exploring itself, expressing itself and at the same time observing that expression from other angles; sometimes down to the point of short-circuiting in infinite recursion of feedback. A black and white being, in which all the depths and the heights coexisted; very clearly a being in need of Love, of a sweeping wave of change; and at the time I repeatedly and adamantly resolved to be part of that change, of that healing process. 

The whole night has been spent elaborating on the subtleties of Oneness; it's often been of concepts above those of heart and mind, but those are our two main interfaces to knowing anyway.  
It's stuff that I was struggling to put into conscious thoughts once I came out the other side, the awake one. And when I couldn't, I'd just dip back into hypnagogia and get some further elaboration now that I knew where the holes were. It's a warm sort of conforting, tuning in with a bigger Self waiting just an opening away.
 
Among the teachings it provided, it was a clear demonstration of how sometimes there's a sharing of our very Being going on, through the Heart (the energetic one). How this connection is so profound and vital as to make us One, even in practice.

Our heart is what connects us to the heart of All. The One Heart containing the collective wisdom and presence of us all. The connection to the Source Intelligence, and all of us that are connected to it.  
It's this woven tapestry that we don't have to feel just a thread of. It is the mosaic in which we are not just a tassel; we are part of the greater picture, and that picture both is more of us, and it is us. It is a deep intelligence that is distinctively different from that of the mind, in ways that genuinely feel fully indescribable sometimes. It is a purer connection to the force of unification, that sees past the duality into the Unity that convolves us all.

Some have visited the Akhashic Records, but in a sense, I think I prefer this sort of ongoing connection. The clarity and transparency of self that allows to receive what is needed to express the highest presence of ourselves, directed towards all parts of our life experience, moment by moment. 

It is the acting rooted in something that goes beyond knowledge or belief, much like the streaming of water in a river goes beyond knowledge or belief. The expression of our infinity as something tangible and actioned. The living of the *We consiousness*, both inside and outside. The knowing that those outside us, that appear in separation, are really just us from a different point of view, and the living as if; and the knowing that what happens inside, the thoughts, the feelings, are a result of many, interacting, acting in concert, in an aware, deliberate, and playful manner; and are far, far from a single individual's results.  

Even when not consciously discerned, I can feel that there's been very definite shifts in the inner life, and that many of those changes have been either directly acknowledging "outside" influences, and accepting them, and welcoming them to take a bigger part in the way of things, or as results of those interactions and iterations.

### Small followup

As an addendum, I've had a small car collision this very morning, which has put me on the spot to consolidate, and put to practice, the concepts I'd absorbed and the shapes of being that had been envisioned. It was rather eerie, noticing how many details had converged to force me to not just dismiss the issue (the guy was in a hurry, and absolutely had to get the accident report because the car was rental, and I had complications with my own driving license etc.) and instead, learning to really tap in and navigate it by the heart, instead of the mind. I could have gone through it wallowing in misery all the while, but instead I'd like to think we've managed to get some sparks of the Divine through.  
Not to mention the comforting, reassuring presence of Mother Ayahuasca giving her own confirmation. Only a thought away, from all of us.
