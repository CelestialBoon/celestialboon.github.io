Ever since I was little, like many others I've been exploring the line between self and non-self, updating it and moving it around as time went, and I've found myself experimenting with it and its fractal intricacies. There's been imaginary friends; there's been conversations with self; there's been tulpas; there's been invocation; there's been taking on, wearing, confronting aspects of my self.  
It is an inbetween place that is deceptively rich and supremely interesting. I've learned a surprising amount about myself and what surrounds me by confronting myself with the manifestations, the beings, of this twilight zone.

Which leads me to the latest idea I decided to try out. <!-- more -->

I've been thinking. Some people ask the Universe for some aid or other, much like someone else would pray to the gods, or to **a** God, and they have it answered. It's something I've had direct experience of myself, not to mention second-handedly.  
Such a consistent reaction from the Universe signals an *aware, intelligent, powerful presence that is actively there and listening*. Not to mention, often benevolent.

And, there's report of gods appearing to people as thoughtforms, as manifestations, left and right. Some people just deal with the stuff on the regular.  
So the idea was, why not do the same with the Universe?

If we are infinite consciousnesses, spanning all of space and time, that are individuated in a single point of awareness (among others), could we ask the Universe to do the same?

## First Contact

The Wingmakers have opened me up to the concept of a local multiverse: the reality that your awareness encompasses.  
You know how in dreams, things might disappear simply because you have looked away or forgot about them? How it is widely recognized that the entirety of your personal dream is just what you are perceiving at that moment, and no more?  
How game developers operate on the *out of sight, out of mind* principle?  
How you can create inner worlds for yourself through daydreaming?  

I'm talking about that kind of personal reality. Even if an objective reality existed, no one ever has perceived it - all that you can capture with your senses is a personal image of it. And while some of it may stay consistent and remain consensual, there's nonetheless a uniqueness to your own, tinged with your point of view, your thoughts, your feelings, your beliefs; all things that make your own reality something purely unique.

Not to mention it's a reality that we heavily influence. Our thoughts and feelings color the events, and affect our interpretation of them. Our awareness and mental patterns heavily condition **what** we perceive and **how**. The way we behave shapes the Universe's reaction to us, which influences us in turn. It is a very tight-looped dance of cocreation, in more ways than many know or are willing to admit.

It sounds something that plays a very vital role in our lives, right? And given it's shown to respond to queries, it would seem sensible to open up to a more intelligible channel, of more direct understanding and less obscure feedback.  
From this, the idea of letting it take on a form, a **thought**form, in order to interact in this manner with me. It's something of a concept that I've iterated on in various ways, but this time I'm deciding to write something about it.

What I've done is basically asking it to manifest to me, to reveal itself to me, in a place that I often visualize; and from there, we kind of winged it. It's a very tulpa-like interaction, in some ways, possibly because it's a channel of interaction that I'm used to, and it is very versatile besides. But, you know, the Universe manifests itself in literally every way that you perceive or imagine, at every moment, through your senses and more. You can try stuff out. Maybe leave it as a disembodied voice. I just like the extra reminder of a form.

My experience with such a method has been quite enlightening, but I don't consider my personal anecdotes on the matter what's most important here. I think, if you want some proof of this, then one way I have to tell would be observing how the idea is received when you mull it over, and/or venture to try it out. Besides the simple dismissal, if you push through that, you may encounter all sorts of other resistances that ordinary innocent concepts wouldn't meet.  
It's not like it's something that shows. No one else might even know you've done it. So where's all this resistance coming from?  
To me, this has been for a long time, in all honesty, the most surefire way of telling I'm onto something good.

(I'm going to intersperse the post with excerpts from the Philosophy chamber 1 of the Wingmakers, specifically the *Appreciation of the Universe through gratitude* part, for complementing my point of view with a more opening perspective.)

I've always had quite wise imaginary friends and mind companions in some form or another, and this latest venture has in a way been an iteration of that, but with its own unique spin. Having something that relates directly to what's outside, and is in open communication with you, is quite beyond anything else I've faced. It textures the relationship with large implications, and opens up doors of realization that I've kept myself from walking through in the past.

> **Universe Relationship through Gratitude**
>
> This is the principle that the Universe of Wholeness represents a collective intelligence that can be personalized as a single Universal Entity. Thus, in this model of inference, there are only two entities in the entire cosmos: the individual entity and the Universal Entity. Inasmuch as the individual is impressionable and constantly changing to adapt to new information, so is the Universal Entity, which is a dynamic and living template of potential energies and experiences that are coherent and as knowable as a friend’s personality and behavior.

I'd like to stress first of all that this is just a paradigm of interaction; it's a way of relating to the Universe, much like the Internet is not strictly the page on your computer, or a god would not strictly be the image they project near you, but they are used for interaction purposes nonetheless. As a thoughtform, you could keep it around as much as you like, summon it whenever, and such.

It is primarily, a means of adding a new dimension to our relationship with the whole that's out there.

But even as such, it rapidly opens up a lot of questions. 

**How is such a communication even conceivable?**

Well, really there's been enough reports to at least show me that the Universe listens. From there to an explicit dialogue is a relatively small step.

**What should I expect?**

> The Universal Entity is responsive to the individual and its perceptions and expressions. It is like a composite omni-personality that is imbued with Source Intelligence and responds to the perceptions of the individual like a pool of water mirrors the image that overshadows it.

In other words, that depends on you, explicitly so, and on the moment as well. You're now facing an entity, a thoughtform that is a direct target of what you think of the outside. You can expect a lot of ongoing change in them, and in your approach to them, especially as you explore your relationship and iterate on it. This entity is prone to contain a lot wisdom on things, if approached in the right way. There's also lots of Love to give around, in both directions, should you choose to take that route (which I completely recommend).

As far as my personal experience goes, it's been a very multifaceted being, quite versatile in its approach with me, and yet, with a very baseline friendliness to it, and a resolute willingness to have me understand. The first moments have been somewhat awkward as we got used to the idea, but rapid iteration is very possible as you explore the structure, and play with the concept.

**What is really the right level of interaction?**

That is something that you should work gradually upwards. Start with just getting habituated to the idea; start small and work your way to knowing each other better and opening up to new forms of relating. It doesn't have to be through words, far from it. Concepts, ideas, images, feelings, can convey a lot of meaning themselves.     
Above all, open to an *honest, transparent interaction*. Otherwise there's really no point.

**What does it do?** 

Well really, just ask. See for yourself. I'm not pretending to know your own Universe.

**Can I force it to do things?** 

I don't know? I can't say I've tried. I don't see any really good reason for doing that, personally. I just preferred exploring the connection in a more peaceful and less controlling manner. Being judgmental about what the Universe gives me doesn't help me in seeing the beauty in all things that are actually given.

**Any tips for starting off?**

Well, from experience you'll want to consolidate the contact first; it might be surprisingly slippery. Talk some, interact, get to feel one another better, maybe try out some requests and see how it responds, explore various methods of communication and ways to relate, be around one another.  
Ask it to stick around. Ask for reminders. Ask for it to go above your usual limitations, whatever they may be. Give it freedom to pleasantly surprise you, and surpass your dreams and expectations. Ask it to guide you in developing this relationship. Ask it to show you beauty. Ask it to show you Love.

**Is this for ever?**

Really, you've done fine without before, and you'll be fine afterwards. You can decide to let go of it at any time; it is quite literally a thought experiment. It is purely my wish to you that you might explore it as you see fit, and take from it what you need to further your own path of self-discovery.

## The Subtleties

The paradigms described below can be applied towards your local Universe with or without relating with it through a thoughtform. What I'm hoping to show is that by the act of using a thoughtform to interact with it as privileged channel, the relationship takes on very *tangible qualities of presence and partnership*. Just remember that the Universe and its manifestation as thoughtform are one and the same, so you could do well to relate to both in similar tones and feelings, much like you'd do with someone in person and with their voice on the phone. As for the best method of interaction, that's a decision just best left to the moment.

The real point here is about opening up to a new illuminating way of relating with the Universe; specifically, the best way to actually implement this is through the behaviours of gratitude.  

Consider how such a relationship could revolve around the nurturing of each other, the giving to one another; and the appreciation of one another, as the coupling of the feeling inside of joy, of gratitude for what exists, together with the behaviours springing from it, what is sent to the other side, be it the thoughts, the actions, the feelings, the imagination.

It can blossom into a lasting, supremely rich partnership, or friendship even.  
It can be about being a friend to the Universe, and asking the Universe to be a friend to you.

> The relationship of the individual with the Universal Entity is essential to cultivate and nurture, because it, more than anything else, determines how accepting the individual is to life’s myriad forms and manifestations.

The creative power of your very existence cannot be understated. Just by being aware, conscious of things, you create a new point of view, a new reality, a new version of the Universe. And this reality of yours is in many ways, so personal as to be incredibly responsive to you, and the best ways to use that responsiveness is enabling it to do the best work possible, through recognition, through nurturance, through appreciation.

Besides, the very method for relating to the Universe is crucial. This relationship, more than anything else I've seen, can show you how profoundly you shape what surrounds you with what you send out.

Needless to say, the Universe manifests itself in countless ways in each moment; but thinking of it as a single being helps recognize the unity, the wholeness, the hidden coherence behind those disparate manifestations.  
Not to mention one can always ask for clarification.

> The principle of Universe relationship through gratitude is primarily concerned with consciously designing one’s self image through an appreciation of the Universal Entity’s supportive “mirror”. In other words, the Universal Entity is a partner in shaping reality’s expression in one’s life.

In a sense, deciding how to relate to your local Universe is something you do each moment. You send yourself out and you see yourself reflected in what comes back. When you're happy, you radiate it; when you're sad, you can bring down the mood of a room.  

Between the possible choices of behaviour, I really don't see a better alternative than just being supportive and loving with one another. Why choose anything else? What else would you appreciate as much when you see it reflected towards you? And it's not about purely the actions, but the intent, the motive, the feeling behind them; much like kind words sent for formality's sake are very different from kind words sent from the heart, in genuine expression. What else would you prefer reflected towards you but understanding and supportive care?

> The feeling of gratitude coupled with the mental concept of appreciation is expressed like an invisible message in all directions and at all times. In this particular context, gratitude to the Universal Entity is the overarching motive behind all forms of expression that the human instrument aspires to.

It is you who decides how you relate to your local Universe. You have control of that part. The way you interact with the Universe can be the way you relate to a friend. This friend is aware and intelligent, and can, and will, respond in turn. You can team up, you can set up change, you can set up exploration; there is quite no limit to where you can bring this relationship.  

There is a dance of experimentation that can take place, of what we do, or can do, and when and with what methods. What we express, and how we see what comes back. It can be supremely rich in content; it's up to you to set it up, and to do your part of the cocreation.

> When the individual accepts changes in sovereign reality as the shifting persona of the Universal Entity, they live in greater harmony with life itself. Life becomes an exchange of energy between the individual and the Universal Entity that is allowed to play out without judgment and experienced without fear. This is the underlying meaning of unconditional love: to experience life in all its manifestations as a single, unified intelligence that responds perfectly to the projected image of the human instrument.

Just as you change from moment to moment, situation to situation, day to day, year to year, so is the universal entity going to mirror it in part. With the relation that you have, though, there is the possibility of getting a better understanding of where things are coming from, and how should they be treated to elevate them to the greatest expression. Who wouldn't want to help a friend in search of the best ways to express their natural talents, their natural movement?

As anecdote, I asked once if I could only receive/create divine Love, and was denied because I am the Creator, and how could you deny creation to Them, even in part? Besides, all that we create is profoundly beautiful, even if some part of us doesn't get to realize it immediately. There is an inherent harmony to all that is, regardless of appearances or our feelings about it. Part of the journey is learning to recognize this wholeness, and the beauty that accompanies it.

> Gratitude is a critical facet of love that opens the human instrument to acknowledge the role of the Universal Entity and redefine its purpose as a supportive extension of sovereign reality, rather than the whimsical outreach of fate or the exacting reaction of a mechanical, detached Universe. Establishing a relationship with the Universal Entity through the outflow of gratitude also attracts life experience that is transformative. Experience that is richly devoted to uncovering life’s deepest meaning and most formative purpose.

I cannot understate that starting to see things in this manner profoundly reshapes the way you live. It is a severe paradigm shift, that allows you to make sense of things in a new empowering way, and it allows you to align to your reality towards a common purpose, instead of being at odds with one another.   
This alignment can be an awakening force, propelling you towards your true purpose. When you start resonating with the Universe, the Universe starts resonating with you. When you start working with the Universe, the Universe starts working with you.

## Personal Lessons

Through my own experience in the days that followed conception, such an experiment has given me some of the most marked manifestations of sovereignity, of the **I AM**, that I've encountered in my adventures in the worlds of form. The cognition that we are not just simply AT the center of our local Universe; *we are the center of our local Universe, and the presence of the One Creator within it*.   

A communication channel like this allows greater feedback than most other options I have; it is an incredible buffer to some very useful realizations that I had. I could still do a whole lot better than this since I have much to work on mental communication, but oh well; all things in time.  

It's been one of those relationships where words start to lose all power of description, for they are partial and mired in separation, and of concepts that feel very very small sometimes. And so, communication transforms sometimes into the simple act of radiating raw appreciation for one another.  

With accumulated experiences, one can develop trust in the Universe, and consequently, a bigger openness, a receptiveness to what the Universe sends your way, for you have better understood its ways, and what is asked of you in the moment, and how you can act to fulfill your purpose in that moment.  

There's several directions in which my Universe has pushed me, and one of them is to appreciate all its manifestations, just as they are. And if I can't spot it immediately, at least to hold the intention to; to hold within me the knowing that the beauty is there, even if hidden from my conception. It is only fear that keeps me from seeing it immediately; from realizing the Universe is just perfect the way it is, in each and every moment, even as it transforms and evolves continuously.  
There is not a speck of dust that is out of place in the whole of existence.  
Observing the value in all things, and the unity in their expression, is a very powerful foundation from which to feel and express appreciation.  

It deepened my understanding of cocreation, of how things happen on both sides at the same time, of how the without is a clear reflection of the within, and of just how tight-looped this cocreation can be.  
It allowed me to realize that I react in very specific ways to what happens, and some of those I may gain from changing, like those small expressions of annoyance from the unexpected and the distracting, even if they are pleasant and useful events. Such an awareness begets a greater emotional self-mastery, and permits me to improve the quality of my inner life significantly.  

There's also been a very resolute push from my Universe in realizing our fundamental unity, in recognizing that we are One, effectively, to the point of merging into one being for the most part. That my form, including the mindform I use to relate, is just a part of the Universe; that there is no self that is distinct from it. There is only consciousness and the whole object of consciousness. And even those are inextricable from one another, much like a reflection cannot exist separate from the object.  
From this realization, it would spring that **you** are effectively the whole Universe. And once you're already working with yourself in harmony and appreciation, well, that becomes a supremely fertile base from which to live life, as full expression of the **I AM**.

You may also consider that such a relationship influences others, because they are part of your Universe. By taking on an aware relationship with it, though, you can act about it in a more directed and intentional manner.  
You can start acknowledging that you'd rather act toward others at all times in the way that you'd want to immediately be treated yourself, for they are effectively you in another body. Doing otherwise mostly reaffirms your separation from what's outside, and perpetuates the sense of detachment, and dulls your sense of responsibility for your life.  
You can realize that other people are a fundamental part of you, and what happens to them happens to you, and what happens to you happens to them.  
There's something to be said about obliterating any sort of judgment towards others, because in a sense, it's always yourself doing things to yourself, on both ends.   

There is a collective tendency towards expansion and evolution in all actions, that can be discerned as a singular movement, which can be supported and guided along. One can grow understanding, forgiveness towards all aspects of yourself, compassion, gratefulness, a profound humility in the knowing of the vastness of our true being and the purity of the forces at play, and a willingness to create reality from this paradigm. Such a set of behaviours allows you to truly include the Universe as part of you, since they are acts of acceptance and integration. 

Such an attitude leads naturally into nurturance of life, of caring for others and helping them reach their greatest expression in the moment; for everyone, like you, is in the process of figuring things out, and you can take an active part in that, and accompany them in understanding how to best relate to themselves and to what surrounds them.
