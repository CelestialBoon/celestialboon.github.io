I think I figured out the trick to alchemy.

To clarify, I'm definitely not the first to have done it; as always, I'm standing on the shoulders of giants. Many pieces have been left around for me to figure it out, even if it's taken me a while to put them together.

Like for example how all sensation is neutral, and how it's recognized in the BDSM scene that pain is merely "strong sensation."

Or how suffering is merely born from resistance to What Is.

Or, the reality of what we fear the most is what we desire the most.

It turns out that not just sensation, but in general emotion is also neutral. Which leaves us the choice of how to take events, with possibly surprising results, just like people can reach ecstasy from the pain of being whipped by their partner.

It's been said that anger is a clarity that's gone out of focus, or how anxiety is really some other emotion that is being suppressed and wants to come out.

It seems to me that more in general, every negative emotion is the flip side of a positive one.

Specifically, fear is a mask of ecstasy.

Like, you know how people can be excited at having something and then immediately fear for losing it? That's exactly the thing. That fear is the same energy, but tone-shifted into fear instead of joy.

The fear of death (as transformation) is the same energy as the love of life (as ongoing transformation).

Envy can be a tone-shift of inspiration, or of joy for seeing someone's gift realized and shared.

Anger is a tone-shift of the clarity that brings impulse to action.

Resentment can become appreciation for someone who taught us a valuable, strong lesson in life, by whatever means they used.

Judging someone for a lack can transform into the joy of the opening of the opportunity to share yourself, to teach, to show, to reveal.

And the trick is that this shift can be made consciously, in each moment.

Like how people skydive to turn their **fear** of falling into the **elation** of falling.

Or how people can choose to defuse a situation by laughing it up.

Or any of the uncountable, wordless ways we can transmute our inner states towards understanding, towards forgiveness, towards compassion, towards appreciation, and so on.

Each moment energies stream into us, events happen, experiences are made, we feel things, and each moment we are presented with the choice of how to take what happens. It is the choice between fear and love.

This is what free will is about. It is exactly the freedom to experience the energies that come to us either in the ways of fear, or in the ways of love. A choice made each and every moment.

This is what is really meant with the "choice between good and evil."

For example, our very inbreath is the invisible coming to fill the visible, out of pure lust for life. But then this desire can manifest as fear/hate for life, or as love for life. Desire is the motor, but its thrust is in our hands to direct one of two ways.

It is said that (shamanic) ecstasy is the riding between boundless joy and sheer terror, but that's because, borne out of an ongoing confrontation with the Unknown, such a choice has to be renewed every single moment. It's the riding of the crest of great emotional energy.

Alchemy is the practice of transmutation of energies, and being able to shift the energies of your local universe into love is what emotional self-mastery is about.

> James: If your human instrument is fear-based, locked in the rigidity of the left, reptilian brain, you’re more likely to broadcast fear, insecurity and depression—for example. These emotions are a form of energy and, like all energy, they are conserved. In a sense, energy is never created, it is transformed or recycled. I can take energy that is dense and closed, and I can transform it to an energy that is opening to the frequency of love. I can be an alchemist of energy, and instead of trying to turn iron into gold, I turn anger into kindness… or depression into interconnection… or indifference into compassion.

> Energy then informs matter. Energy is many things by human standards… it can be physical energy used to produce something like work or to play a sport. It can be emotional energy that deals with love or anger. It can be a mental energy that helps us solve a problem or capitalize on an opportunity. It can be spiritual energy that activates and sustains our interest in the culture of soul.
> 
> These different types of energies have different frequencies. Some are condensed energies that are heavy—in a sense. Some are light. We’ve all felt these different energetic fields in rooms or public spaces or… or nature, and we’ve all felt them within ourselves. Sometimes we’re buoyant and joyful, and the energy—at least emotionally—is light and easy. Other times we’re heavy with disappointment or fear or frustration. We feel these energies. They’re not abstractions to us… or words on paper. They have a visceral reality in our local universe.

> Being an alchemist is being able to transform energy. To shift energy. Not to let densities build up and calcify, because these are the things that weigh us down, and make our abilities to be alchemists for ourselves and others more difficult.

This is also the principle behind [tonglen](https://www.lionsroar.com/how-to-practice-tonglen/). Of how all the suffering in the world can be turned into the purest love, simply by breathing it in and letting the heart do the magic. This is the immense power of our hearts.

And, shadow work is the reclaiming of the personal channels of energy that have been shifted into fear and suppressed because of it. It is the reappropriation of one's personal power by means of loving what has been feared.

Our greatest fears come from the channels of our greatest power, our strongest desires; and all those channels can be re-opened and healed (transmuted) to provide renewed influx of life, of energy, of love, of creativity, of plenty, that are all rightfully ours.

It is a path to mastery, and it is naturally one that requires practice, contemplation, openness, and plenty of understanding and compassion. I've experienced it personally; it is very possible to walk it successfully.

There is nothing that needs to be feared.
