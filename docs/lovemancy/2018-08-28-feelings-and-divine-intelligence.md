<br>

For a long while I've looked for something that would collate the many insights about divine intelligence that are arranged in the Wingmakers materials about how one can begin the process of accessing such intelligence, and expressing it in one's life; the required mindset, the overall structure, the useful frameworks, the various techniques, the recommended steps.  
Ultimately, I've decided to work on such a resource myself. <!-- more -->

The purpose of such a guide is to provide the general direction to proceed in order to reach a vibrant relationship with the Divine within you. 

> Just as the physical heart is the center of our human body, the energetic heart is the center of our spiritual life, and the gateway through which our highest nature reveals itself.

Developing such a connection is something that I personally repute as vitally important. If you're wondering why, I could suggest having a read at [Art of the Genuine][aotg].

> The art of the genuine is the practice of coherence between the deeper awakening of the heart virtues within each of us, and their faithful expression in the worlds of form. Those individuals who are awakened to the frequencies of the energetic heart within and practice—to their best ability in the moment—the expression of these frequencies in their behaviors and actions are practicing their highest purpose.

If you're somewhat acquainted with the new, transformative times we're in, then I also recommend a pass at [The Energetic Heart: Its Purpose in Human Destiny][tee].

> You need to only imagine and visualize this intelligence of Spirit coming into your body and passing through you to all who cross your path, and when you do this, you have brought your mission to earth. You have grafted an aspect of heaven to an aspect of humanity and earth. And this is why you are here now.

What follows is an arranged collection of methods for the stages of finding, nurturing, and becoming the presence of your greater self within you. All quotes within it are taken from the Wingmakers materials.

Remember always that what is presented here is primarily a framework; it is not a step-by-step guide. You can take from here just what resonates within you, to apply it in your life.  
Such content is only meant to connect you to the greater intelligence residing at your core. From there, you are heavily encouraged to follow it faithfully, and create your own path, devise your own variants, shape your own methods and techniques; and possibly, share your newfound insights, iterations, and discoveries with others.

> You can borrow whatever works for you, whatever resonates with your spiritual center, and you can take these seeds and scatter them around you, and perhaps they will grow into something that supports your journey. However, these seeds are already inside you. Do not deny the spiritual ground you walk on every moment of your life. Do not pretend that you are an automaton of a system that is designed by human or even extraterrestrial hands. You are free to believe and contemplate the highest frequencies of unity regardless of where you live, what your work is, how old you are, how educated you are or what your state of health is. If you practice this contemplation, if you bring self-responsibility to your spiritual life, and you express the messages of unity in your behaviors, what is it that you can possibly lack?

### What this is

So how does this work? What is the connection between divine intelligence and our feelings?

Consider when someone is angry and lashes out: people say they are possessed by that anger, that they are acting out that anger. That they are letting anger dictate their actions.

Notice the phrasing? How the anger is actually directing the self there? Much like one would take a decision based on some thoughts, that person is acting based on the anger. 

And if intelligence is what codifies and directs action, and we attribute intelligence to thoughts, then it makes sense to attribute intelligence to emotions as well, or more in general, to feelings, since they can all make us act in certain ways as soon as we follow them, like pain would make us flinch away, or hilarity would make us laugh, etc.

In the same way, there is a certain intelligence present within the heart, the energetic heart, in the form of feelings, that is informed from a greater reality than the physical here and now; it is not the only such intelligence in there, for the heart is a supple instrument that can resonate with all sorts of frequencies; but it is nonetheless, one that is always present, and that is always accessible, if in different degrees. And it is the one that I would love to reintroduce you to.

> **Teacher**: [...] The heart is also the gateway to the compassion frequency of love—the purest force of the multiverse.
>
> **Student**: I’ve never heard of this before. What do you mean by the compassion frequency of love?
>
> **Teacher**: Love, like all things dimensional, can be separated into a spectrum of frequencies—each frequency a part of the wholeness, but each possessing a different intelligence.
>
> **Student**: Intelligence?
>
> **Teacher**: Are all forms of love the same?
>
> **Student**: Of course not.
>
> **Teacher**: Love imbued with compassion and understanding is different from love that is stubborn and selfish, is it not?
>
> **Student**: Yes… but I don’t think of it as a difference in intelligence in the love itself, but rather the person expressing it.
>
> **Teacher**: That is because you don’t understand that emotions have an embedded intelligence based on their frequency and how the frequency resonates with the higher circuits of the multiverse.
>
> **Student**: I don’t understand.
>
> **Teacher**: Think of the multiverse as eleven holographic spheres of consciousness, each interpenetrating the one that is more inward. Only the outer sphere contains all spheres, and this is the consciousness of First Source, while the innermost sphere is the consciousness of inanimate objects like a stone or seashell.
Love is separated into frequencies that resonate in harmony with each of these “spheres” or domains of consciousness. Similarly, the heart itself consists of different layers of consciousness, and each “layer” has an intelligence of perception and expression. This intelligence is linked to the brain and higher mind, so that the human instrument is capable of expressing from any dominant frequency or sphere of the multiverse.
>
> **Student**: Including the level of First Source?
>
> **Teacher**: Yes.
>
> **Student**: So the heart is the multiverse inside each of us?
>
> **Teacher**: It is the gateway to the multiverse because of its ability to decode emotional frequencies from the highest levels of the multiverse and express them into three-dimensional environments through a human instrument.

### What those feelings are

> “There is nothing to guard, protect or defend, my dear Alija,” she whispered in measured tones. “We are creatures of Spirit, in the service of Spirit, and even though we wear the biology of a forgetful animal, we are intimate partners of the One Creator. Our life is cared for and cherished by this Universal Spirit and we are wise to trust it, for it is the very same intelligence that designed the miraculous body you wear and the universe architecture that drapes the night sky.
>
> “You have only to listen to your heart’s feelings of love, expressed through the body of light that is within you. This is the key understanding that holds deep relevance to you. The living truth is your realization of this noble and powerful reality, lifting it from the realm of the abstract to the heartfelt experience of expression. It is your instant-on relationship with the Divine.”

There are many names to the feelings sitting deep within the heart that speak to us of something greater. Some have named it divine Love; other terms for it would be divine Intelligence, divine Light, divine Inspiration, Creator's Presence, the Unification Force, the Designer's Force, etc. I've even heard people call it soul's fire.  
I'm sure there's plenty more names for it, for everyone can perceive it at their center, and access it; and besides, we have no ordinary, commonplace name for it.

This form of love, this intelligence, is expressed inside ourselves through particular feelings, that can be called the Heart Virtues. 

[Here is a brief description of the six main virtues](https://write.as/q29amergvha7v.md). 

These descriptions are but a starting point from which to develop your own understanding of these forces, and of their rich interplay.

> And this picture is what we call love, and yet when people sling this word around in their everyday life, it is absent this meaning. It is another thing altogether, and so the first thing one learns on the heart’s path, is to redefine love as the nectar of the undefinable.

### Soul

> In the human instrument, the entity, for the most part, is silent and unmoving. It appears like a fleeting whisper of gladness that touches you like a mountain wind. It is quiet like a deep ocean. Yet, the entity is coming forward into the time-space universe as a harbinger of Source Reality expansion. It is beginning to make itself known as it truly is. Many feel the shadow of their entity as it approaches. They consign all forms of definition to this “shadow”, seldom believing it to be the torchbearer of their total selfhood. Here is where all the vows of faithfulness, all the ceremonies of love, and all the feelings of hope should be centered and given over to the sovereign entity that each of us is.

The entity, or soul, or higher self, or the Sovereign Integral, is the you outside spacetime. It is the greater you that assumes the viewpoint of the human body in order to live and explore and learn.  
It is effectively, the Creator of your current experience.

> "This entity is the Creator's Presence formulated inside your body and mind here on earth, but its native world is without the structures of spacetime, and for this reason, this indivisible entity is not conditioned by spacetime as your body and mind are. Because it lacks this indoctrination, it simply observes, without judgment; it navigates without a goal; it guides without ego; it co-creates without possession."

It is the you that is richly and intricately connected to the whole of the Universe, and is able to access the greater wisdom and intelligence of this collective, and of Source Itself.

It experiences without judgment because each experience is valid, and with each comes the possibility to learn from it, to further the understanding of love. The darkness is what coerces the light to come forward. Without the call for love, without the need for love, the frequencies of love need not be summoned.

This need is however all around us, and so the entity quietly transmits the divine frequencies to us. It waits for us to reconnect, to extend an invitation, so that the channels of communication can be reappropriated, strengthened, expanded, and put to proper use.

> The energetic heart—the physical heart’s quantum equivalent—is the portal of the soul’s consciousness in intersection with the Designing Force. It resides at the heart chakra site, and it is the knowingness of the soul or higher spirit within the individual. The six heart virtues emanate from this stronghold of the energetic body, and it is this energy center that we must nurture and consciously activate within us.

### Invite in

> The heart is the portal of the human instrument that enables it to feel the currents of love that flow in and around every individual, at all times. [...] It’s really a sensory system that enables that feeling of connection to others and our mutual Creator.

The heart is a receptive organ, home of the emotional and intuitive system. It always holds a connection to the divine frequencies, but it is not always perceived.  

The perception of the divine intelligence within us might be obscured by the present densities, the layers of other emotions, the knots in our usual patterns, the fears and the beliefs. For an explicit technique on how to clear those passageways, I recommend reading the fullness of [Lyricus Discourse 6][lyricus].

For another, to be properly felt, such presence has to be actively invited to take on a greater part in our life; there has to be an active resolve to bring those qualities, those virtues, into the forefront of our consciousness; it requires reaching out to what exists within us, and a willingness to surrender to those forces once they are perceived, once they are recognized, so that they can bring their intelligence to our behaviours.

### Feel

> Remember that language is a tool of limitation. Feeling is an antidote of limitation that permits the human instrument to leap over the boundaries of the logical mind and witness firsthand the wordless power of collective energy individuated.

I think that it has to be stressed that we are talking about actual feelings here, that can be perceived, that can be *felt*; that can pervade your body, your imagination; that can be as quiet as a whisper or as overwhelming as a tempest.

It is part of the common wisdom that love is perceived in the form of feelings, and its divine variant is no different in this regard. The energetic heart, the chest area, is the privileged channel through which they can be felt, but they are far from limited in this manner in their expression.

A core foundation from which they operate is the feeling of interconnectedness of all life, into the single organism that is all of us. It is useful to keep this paradigm in mind, or even to contemplate it in the quiet hours, in order to facilitate the absorption of such feelings.

Once they are perceived, don't look upon them as weak; they are what rewrites your reality. They can be your prime intuition, the center of your every action, the director of your experience. It is worthy to cherish such feelings, to maintain their presence, and to cultivate their presence within you.

With time, with practice, you will be able to discern them better; they will be felt more clearly, more spontaneously; and acting upon them will become more natural.

Those feelings operate exclusively in the present moment. In their presence, no comparison with the past is necessary; no worry about the future will serve you.

### Perceive

The present moment consists of both the outside and the inside, and the heart virtues come to you in response to both, as means of elevating the present events to their highest expression.
In such a context, it is useful to become (and remain) aware of the present moment, in all its expressions, so as to realize what is being brought to you, and what you can cocreate with.

> The heart virtues come to you, and you’re expressing them. Situational awareness, in this context, is simply being perceptive of their entry into your local universe in the moment. Sometimes it’s very obvious, sometimes it’s very subtle… almost undetectable. It’s important to perceive what you’re being given unconditionally, as much as it is to express unconditionally.
>
> You could call it precognitive appreciation. Your in-breath is an example… it brings you life. Water is another example. A kind word from a colleague is another example. The list is very long. So you become adept at sensing how the universe and your local universe is bringing you virtues, even when they appear not to be present. That’s the unconditional part. The hard part. But everything in this world is about cycles and ratios, and these always modulate and shift in spacetime.

### Pray

Remember always that you are not alone in this. As many hurdles that you might face in the pursuit of this connection, be it distractions, fears, or old patterns, or something else, you are never alone in this, and you don't need to be. 

Reach out to the presence within you to assist you in this. Pray to the universe, that it might bring you closer to your essence.

As you do this, life will press you to grow in your understanding and compassion; it will catalyze your transformation. It will accompany you in the discovery.  
The universe around you is anything but the blind causality of atoms. It is the Creator's presence taken form; it is a mirror of compassion.

For some more insight on how to develop a more transformative relationship with the Universe, I've written [a piece on the matter](https://celestialboon.github.io/consciousness/2018/08/03/universe-days-of-i-am.html). Alternatively, there's a [short summary](https://www.wanttoknow.info/wingmakers#gratitude) on the original philosophy paper, a [less short summary](https://www.wanttoknow.info/transformation#gratitude), or [the original paper in question](<https://www.wingmakers.com/wp-content/themes/wingmaker/style/dark/pdffiles/Philosophy%20Chamber%201%20(optimized).pdf>).

### Surrender

> "Each person is their own First Source. Just as First Source divided itself into an Observer-Creator and a Dimensional-Experiencer, so has each of us, but at a comparatively microscopic level. We mimic our Creator in more ways than most imagine, and this is but one example."
>
> "Okay, so let's say I'm more than just this puny little wisp of a human. Then how do I bring this Presence, as you call it, into my Dimensional self?"
>
> "Only life itself can do this. But your life is one that will demand that the larger self—your Presence—steps forward."
>
> "So life itself extracts this?"
>
> Simon nodded. "Yes."
>
> "So I wait?"
>
> "Life is always calling you."
>
> "In what way?"
>
> "Life constantly beckons you to engage with it using your heart's intelligence and the virtues therein, like forgiveness, compassion, understanding, humility, appreciation, and valor. Life is the partner to your development. It is not a passive observer, but rather it is your Presence entering your human consciousness, encouraging you to apply what you know—not the facts and recitations of your head put there by others in your world, but the virtues you instinctively know in your heart.
>
> "How you respond to the Presence of Life determines the potency and depth of the Presence in your life."
>
> Maia lit up. "So if I chose to forgive Kamil's murderers and the Church, I would be activating this Presence, drawing it further into my Dimensional world. Is this what you're saying?"
>
> Simon nodded. "Yes, but it must be when you can be authentic. Don't rush it, but don't ignore it either. It's a balance, and when your heart is ready, it'll announce its readiness, and when this happens, you will know."

Remember that we are talking here of a source of intelligence; it's not going to take over if you don't let it. It has to be allowed space, and presence, and predominance.  
It moves with its own rhythms, and operates from its own framework.

The best way to approach it is *not* to try and bend it to our will, to our immediate desires, to our perceived needs, but instead, to open in surrender, and to receive what is given, unconditionally. Through such practice, we can learn to discern the presence of the Creator within the big and the small things, in the fast-paced and in the slow-paced events both.  

There is no need to rush anything in this; only to accept, and to allow. One only needs to hold the intent present to receive, with the knowing that what is needed will come at the moment when it is needed.

### Express

> The language of the mind is words. The language of the heart is feelings. But the language of our Presence is behaviors, or activity. 

As any form of intelligence, it is possible to act upon the feelings of divine inspiration; in fact, it is the truest use of such intelligence. They can uplift situations, transmute emotions, and ease transformations of all kinds.

> If you stay in the intelligence of your Presence, by giving it your attention, then the things that come within your local multiverse that have a lower density, they will have minimal effect, as you can— from the empowerment of your Quantum Presence—transform them with ease.

The best way to operate on them is through coherency, that is, the transparent translation of such feelings into action, into behaviours, even if it is simply holding the mental concept of gratitude, or the transmission of such frequencies at an energetic level.

They are uniquely suited to be expressed in the moment they are received, for they move in nowness; and they can be acted upon in a natural manner, much like other feelings can be expressed.

There are all manners of ways in which they can be lived upon, but for a more comprehensive list I remit myself to the [Living from the Heart paper][lfth], and the [When-Which-How guide][wwh].

As manner of example, one way to use them that is not mentioned there is to bless drinking water with your appreciation; to imprint your vibration of gratitude upon it, through the conscious choice to share such frequency with it.

Another is to [complement energy work](https://celestialboon.github.io/occult/2018/08/15/emotional-alchemy.html) with such vibrations.

> Do you see how simple and elegant it is? There is intention, or co-creation. There is visualization. There is the activation of feeling connected. There is release. There is outflow. There is heart-centric focus. And there is the lingering appreciation frequency.

### Allow

Divine intelligence possesses deeply transformative qualities. If you become aware of how it is flowing unimpeded through the expansive you, as pervasively as oxygen is brought to all cells of the body, you can feel how it operates in changing you, adapting you to the fresh new present moment, transforming the old stuck densities, transmuting the self into a new vision, again and again, in iteration. 

One definition of self-love is this realization that we are allowed to be all of ourselves *right now*; that at the same time, we accept everything that we are in the moment, and we acknowledge that there is continuous, deep transformation going on of our expression in the worlds of form, guided by greater realities than just the physical; that each moment is different, and perfect just the way it is, and that moment is ourselves, our full expression, and each moment furthers our understanding of love.

Guided by such feelings, you can let the divine Light circulate unimpeded through you, and from the outside to the inside, and from the inside to the outside, in the realization that a system is always in deep communication with each of its elements; and that all equilibria are dynamic, and based on continuous communications and transformations going below the surface.

In particular, focus can be expended on the parts of self that would resist such change, or that repute themselves immune, or that want no part in this, such as the fears. They are part of the whole too; let them go with the flow.

> **Student**: What is the fourth and final step of this process?
>
> **Teacher**: It is sometimes referred to as light distribution, though I prefer to think of it as light connection.
>
> **Student**: How does it work?
>
> **Teacher**: Just as the physical heart distributes oxygen via the blood to the periphery of the physical body, the quantum heart distributes light via visual energy and emotional authenticity to the borders of the human instrument. The light distribution technique is to imagine light circulating—unimpeded—throughout the expansive you.
>
> **Student**: I’m not sure what that means.
>
> **Teacher**: The human instrument consists of the physical body, emotional system, and the facets of the mind. The grid that interconnects these elements and causes them to operate efficiently as a system is similar to the veins and arteries of the physical body. This grid conveys light that in turn unifies a quantum field and allows it to operate independently of the multiverse. We sometimes refer to this individuated grid as the expansive you.
>
> **Student**: So I am this loose confederation of light particles that somehow manages to coalesce into a body and mind, and to this I need to visualize light being distributed without blockages or interruptions. Is this the idea?
>
> **Teacher**: You simply need to place your attention on the reality of what you are. It only takes a few moments, but it is critical that you practice this technique frequently and in a specific manner.
>
> **Student**: How frequently?
>
> **Teacher**: That is up to you, but you cannot do it too much.
>
> **Student**: Why do I even need to be conscious of this? It seems that the light flows just fine without my direction.
>
> **Teacher**: It does, but you are not directing it, you are accessing it, touching into this holographic gridwork of light that is the fundamental structure of your existence in the three-dimensional environment.
>
> **Student**: Maybe you should just explain the technique, and I’ll stop asking questions.
>
> **Teacher**: If you could concentrate this grid of light—make it brighter, more intense; what do you think the result would be?
>
> **Student**: More energy?
>
> **Teacher**: No. It can actually have the opposite effect in the sense that the body is fatigued and weakened.
>
> **Student**: So distributing light is not about concentrating it?
>
> **Teacher**: No. It’s balancing the light quotient within the human instrument and ensuring it is coherent, rhythmic, and free flowing.
>
> **Student**: It sounds like you’re describing the physical heart again.
>
> **Teacher**: This is the natural state of the heart and the entire human instrument, but in the day-to-day interactions with the three-dimensional environment, the human instrument can lose this balance and slip into an incoherent, arrhythmic, and entangled state of existence.
The heart perceives this state and, without knowledge of the proper techniques, responds in kind, fueling the mental dysfunction and physiological inefficiency with its energy.
>
> **Student**: More “cloud” cover?
>
> **Teacher**: Precisely. This is why this step in the process is important because it helps the heart synchronize its energy with the deeper, sub-quantum structures upon which you depend.
>
> **Student**: What do I do?
>
> **Teacher**: Can you visualize your heart beating in your chest distributing oxygen to your body and brain system?
>
> **Student**: Yes.
>
> **Teacher**: Imagine this same function is occurring in your quantum, or energetic heart, and that instead of veins and arteries, there are filaments of light that diverge from your quantum heart and connect you to a broader grid. This grid is the source of your existence as a physical being.
Now, you can think of these filaments as both roots and wings. Roots in the sense that they anchor and ground your existence; and wings in the sense that they provide uplift and expansion to your life.
Throughout the day, simply feel the energy structure that surrounds you. When you do this, imagine that your heart is “plugging in” or connecting to this structure, even if you cannot visualize it, feel its presence like a primordial soil of life-giving energy. Feel this connection as a rhythmic pulsing of light, flowing from the grid into your heart system and then flowing out from your heart to the rest of your body.
>
> **Student**: I felt this just listening to you.
>
> **Teacher**: That is the technique for the fourth and final step.

### Breathe

> Dr. Neruda: “It takes great alertness to live and express in the now. Human beings have the tendency to live in our past memories or future concerns. This was what I was doing and it took me from the now. And the now is where our life essence expresses. It isn’t in the past or future, only the consciousness framework pivots between past and future, so if you find yourself in there, you know you are not in your essence.
>
> “When I realized this, I read from the WingMakers philosophy that breath was the magnet of nowness. It was the element that brought the human being into nowness by being aware of their breathing. I also learned that there were different kinds of breathing that enabled this sense of nowness to penetrate more vividly into the hologram of deception.
>
> “The point is that simply being aware of my breath helped, as the WingMakers put it, to center me in stillness. This, by the way, doesn’t mean that you’re in a quiet room. You can be in a meeting at work, and center yourself in stillness through your breath. But by being in this internal centeredness I was in a better position to feel my own sense of expression, and that’s what was missing in my initial efforts to integrate this process. I didn’t have a good starting point for my practice of the heart virtues, and I was directing them outward—to other people or events, and not myself first.
>
> “Once I made that adjustment, it helped me to identify my essence and distinguish it from my mind system. Life essence is authentic in oneness and equality and exclusively moves in nowness. The consciousness framework pivots between the past, present and future and operates in separation. If you express the heart virtues from the consciousness framework, especially outwardly, they won’t have the same potency or affect.”

The breath is an incredibly powerful means of centering awareness in the now. It can be used as meditative focus, or as means of recentering ourselves anytime.  
It can be charged through imagination with all sorts of properties, or you can just let it bring you into stillness and neutral awareness. It is an especially useful tool to summon the heart virtues into our hearts.

> **James**: [...] When you’re practicing conscious breathing, feel how it pulls you into the present moment. In this state of nowness, use your awareness to really feel that you’re in a brand new spacetime—one you’ve never been in before, one that has new energies, new potentialities. Imagine that as you breathe, you’re infusing these new energies into your human instrument, and that this is creating within you a sense of openness, flexibility, coherence, clarity that allows you to be more resilient, agile, giving, intuitively alive, and so on.
>
> Breath relates to spacetime, and this… this brings new energetics into your human instrument. These new energetics can be experienced as new behaviors. So, energy, in this context, informs matter, and matter in this context is behavior.
>
> **Mark**: How does conscious breathing help in developing one’s behavioral intelligence?
>
> **James**: Well, let’s say I practice Quantum Pause, and while I’m breathing, I become conscious of the new spacetime I’m in—that unique part of the universe that my local universe intersects with in that exact moment. I choose to breathe in the feelings of compassion. Every breath I inhale, I imagine it to be compassion, which is to say that any in-breath can be imbued with virtue. I summon it to my human instrument and let it saturate me like an internal waterfall.
>
> …You could be in a jail cell or a villa in the south of France, the spacetime that intersects your local universe can be modified by you. You are the alchemist. The creator. You can use your imaginative power to imbue your in-breath with a virtue like compassion, forgiveness, humility, valor, understanding, joy, love, whatever you would like. You’re the creator, and the new spacetime is your canvas.
>
> The new energy fields that flow through you are carriers, and as they sweep through your local universe—your energy field—they carry it to others, and the distance they’re carried is not bound to earth or limited.

### Bear patience

> Love given is never lost.

Things happen in time. You're working with a force that operates outside spacetime, so it takes some getting used to something that does not follow linear, sequential cause and effect. 

Of course, it is very possible to observe feedback as you move through the expressions, and such feedback can help you familiarize yourself with the uses of such virtues, and the ways they can be chained and combined, but oftentimes this feedback could be internal more than external. As you are asked to navigate the world based on the feelings that are conveying divine intelligence, they can surely shift as a situation changes, and you will be called to change your expression in turn.

That said, it is recommended to use those internal cues as your guidance, more than any external result. Progression does not always equate to an improvement of appearances. Sometimes there's need to cry before one can laugh again. Sometimes it is the venting of the old energies that can make room for the new ones. The ups and the downs of life don't always map to what is happening inside. And sometimes it's just not the right moment for something to happen.

Things go at their own pace, and so it is important to surrender the ego's impulse to see results **now**, and instead, operate in the knowing that a larger picture than the single instant is what matters, and it is this greater picture we are acting in the interests of.

> Patience pays. Do not look for the shortcuts in matters of the heart or soul because space-time is not the force that operates or controls the heart virtues. It is the soul and higher spirit enfolded within the Designing Force that enables these virtues full expression and empowerment within any domain—subtle, gross, or otherwise. There is no density in which the heart virtues are extinguished or marginalized if the individual regularly exercises them, observes their energies, contemplates their outputs, and nurtures their expression. Even in the darkest densities the heart beats true its pulse of connectivity to the divine nature in us all. It is the connecting force that binds us as human spirits.

### Contemplate

The mind is far from a third wheel in this process. It is an active partner of the heart; it is what relates to the world outside the skin, and what helps translate the feelings into thoughts and actions.

> The emotions are the product of how the heart and mind operate together in coherence. If the mind is prayerful, contemplative, receptive, summoning the universe for support, and so on, the mind is then engaged with the heart, because this kind of mindfulness attracts the attention of the heart. It begets behaviors that are intelligent.

Our relationship with the various paradigms can be deepened through active contemplation of their meaning and intelligence, guided by the intuition of feelings.

Much can be explored in such a contemplative manner, like the Heart Virtues,

> I never studied any of the religions of this world… never had an interest. I focused on my heart instead. I studied it. I listened to it. I found all of the frequencies that it resonated to, and I learned how these frequencies could be woven into practices that created connections between the heart and brain and the mind and body.

or the soul inside us,

> “Then you have this immortal, inborn spark that I have given you from myself. And this spark also is you, is it not?”
>
> “Yes.”
>
> “And do you think about this part of you? Do you imagine its reality? Do you contemplate how it operates beneath the physical vehicle of cells and atoms?”

or the paradigm of wholeness itself,

> I am not found or discovered. I am only realized in oneness, unity, and wholeness. It is the very same oneness that you feel when you are interconnected with all of life, for I am this and this alone. I am all of life. If you must search for me, then practice the feeling of wholeness and unity.

etc.

The mind is an almost indispensable co-participant, but it has to come from the right place of collaboration, and surrender to what is given from our greater reality.

> That is what I ask you to do as you read. Remind yourself, “I don’t know, but I’ll contemplate the possibilities.” There is no one living on earth now, in the past, or in the future that knows it all. Everyone must ultimately say to themselves, “I don’t know, but I will contemplate the possibilities.” It is in the contemplation that we feel our way to Oneness, and likewise, it is in our lack of contemplation that we slide back to separation and ego identity.

### Imagine

> “How does anyone sense this Presence or make use of it?” I asked.
>
> “The same way you sense anything non-physical, you feel it.”
>
> “How?”
>
> “By practicing and raising your awareness until you can feel that a heart virtue you are practicing, like forgiveness, is felt as one continuous behavior.”
>
> “What do you mean?”
>
> “If you practice forgiveness to others, even when it’s not returned, it will return to you from the Creator, and you will feel this in subtle ways, and to feel the subtle, you must seek it. You must open yourself to its expression in your life. You must use your imagination.”

The heart has its own imagination, just like the mind does; an imagination that operates in feelings. You could think of a situation that made you angry, or would make you angry, and feel that anger bubbling up right now; in doing so, you have effectively summoned feelings into the present moment.

In the same way visualization is used to help along exercises in energy work, or is at the core of practices like motivation, or envisioning goals, so the imagination (and recall) of feelings can be used to accompany the perception and use of divine intelligence.

> The imagination is a faculty within the heart and mind of every individual. It is that part of us that can exercise a vision that is counterintuitive to the reality that surrounds us. Just as our eye-brain can use a telescope to see distant galaxies, the imagination is like a telescope of our consciousness.

The imagination of feelings can be used to strengthen our connection with the presence within ourselves; to empower visualization exercises; to drench our vision of things with the power of divine inspiration; to accompany contemplations of the mind; and more.

> Sometimes you have to imagine the virtues even when they’re seemingly absent. They will come in time.

Visualization exercises involving such feelings of divine Love can be very useful to bring forward this intelligence more easily, or direct it somewhere in particular, or to create something new and more inspired. It can be of support to any and all applications of this force.

> “All of this imagination feels like a made-up experience… like I’m creating the experience… it’s not really happening—”
>
> “What you experience is yours,” Uncle said firmly. “If you choose to create through your imagination, and your world reflects this, you have created your world differently from those who allow the Controllers to create their world. Your imagination is your antenna to the Presence. The Presence is your connection to your Creator. The connection is what enables the Sovereign Integral state to exist within the human state.”

### Maintain

There are a lot of pointers given in here for a reason: living from the Heart, acting from divine intelligence, is a large shift in paradigm, one that requires presence in the moment, openness, receptivity, and emotional intelligence, among other things.

[In this list](https://write.as/qr5yritw8ecjp.md) are collected various ways to counteract the distractions and the challenges and the wear and tear of daily life, both from inside and outside, as they weigh on the practice; and also techniques to develop and iterate on our connection to the divine.

### Track, Treat, Transform

(The following is quoted from [*Living from the Heart*][lfth])

For those who establish emotional self-mastery as their path, they will need to track, treat and transform their behaviors as they progress on this journey because this is not about instant gratification. This journey is truly focused on connecting with one’s higher guidance (receptivity and listening) and expressing this wisdom into the field in which you live, move, and have your being (transmission and expression).

Let me be clear about the framework of track, treat, transform.

• Track means that the individual can self-report their progress on the six heart virtues over time and track their ups and downs, and see their self-mastery growing against the backdrop of time.

• Treat means that the individual while tracking their progress can see when they hit a snag or vexing problem that takes them off course and then treat this issue like a physician treats a wound or illness. The treat, in this case, is not a reward, but rather a solution or remedy to a problem or emotional misstep.

• Transform is the result of tracking and treating along this journey and seeing how you are transformed into a self-empowered, spiritually vibrant person.

### In closing

> [...] However, true wisdom never comes to an individual until they are ready. And when they are ready, is not in the hands of any human or organization to decide. When a person is ready, truth will find them. They don’t require a search party or a mantra or a guru or a mountaintop cave. True wisdom is in the heart, sober and unencumbered, and ever waiting, and there is no power on earth that can create a barrier between this true wisdom and the individual who is properly prepared.
>
> The only question is what is the best preparation? Is it membership in a collective organization like the Freemasons or a church or a spiritual organization? Is it reading the ancient books of knowledge? Is it going off to sweat lodges and vision quests? For every person, it is the same answer: when you reach out with authentic surrender, and you listen to your heart’s empowerment by expressing the virtues of your heart, your preparations are in process, and everything else simply provides texture, balance, challenge, and context.
