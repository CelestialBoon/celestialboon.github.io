The breath is one of the main instruments of living a heart-centered practice. It is always available, existing only in nowness, incredibly versatile, vastly applicable, and very powerful when harnessed corerctly.

It is the vehicle through which the prana, or soul's presence, the divine intelligence, streams into the body, and with the proper focus, it can massively facilitate the practice of divine love. <!-- more -->

> “When I realized this, I read from the WingMakers philosophy that breath was the magnet of nowness. It was the element that brought the human being into nowness by being aware of their breathing. I also learned that there were different kinds of breathing that enabled this sense of nowness to penetrate more vividly into the hologram of deception.
>
> “The point is that simply being aware of my breath helped, as the WingMakers put it, to center me in stillness. This, by the way, doesn’t mean that you’re in a quiet room. You can be in a meeting at work, and center yourself in stillness through your breath. But by being in this internal centeredness I was in a better position to feel my own sense of expression, and that’s what was missing in my initial efforts to integrate this process. I didn’t have a good starting point for my practice of the heart virtues, and I was directing them outward—to other people or events, and not myself first.
>
> “Once I made that adjustment, it helped me to identify my essence and distinguish it from my mind system. Life essence is authentic in oneness and equality and exclusively moves in nowness. The consciousness framework pivots between the past, present and future and operates in separation. If you express the heart virtues from the consciousness framework, especially outwardly, they won’t have the same potency or affect.”


## Breath as awareness/consciousness aid

> [...] I remembered something I had read in Vanessa’s journal about breathing. The entire page was devoted to one word: Breath. Around this large, beautifully crafted word were tiny words so small I needed to use a magnifying glass to see them. Words like follow the breath, the breathing system is conscious, easy is true, and exclude nothing.
>
> How could such a simple word be the only word in her entire journal that she gave an entire page to? I made my breath the center of my universe in that moment. Nothing fancy, mind you, I just listened to it. I followed every breath I brought in and expelled out. I imagined atoms of oxygen, in the trillions, rushing into my lungs and entering my bloodstream and making the journey to my cells, meeting them within me like ambassadors of their airy world.
>
> That was when I started to feel a shift inside me; some subtle inkling that I had crossed a threshold of one reality and entered a new one. I left my eyes closed. I didn’t really care where I had gone. I kept my focus on my breath.

The breath serves as a reliable anchor of consciousness into the Now, and this goes double for practices that alter one's states of consciousness, for they are often also operating in nowness, and the breath supports and maintains their presence.

It is possible to "ride the breath" in practices like meditation or astral projection, or as support during a psychedelic trip, or to let us accompany the journey into sleep. Or, more in general, just to anchor oneself in the present moment, so to avoid being swept out in memories or ruminations or speculations. The present moment is what is there to be lived, and it serves one very well to actually live in it.

> And how are the Sovereigns present? In every breath that brings life to the human instrument. It is the breath in which the Sovereign’s presence dwells. There is a saying within Lyricus that “If you’re not in your breath, you’re in your mind.” It’s well understood that this is an abstract concept to the Human Mind System, but the Sovereigns live in the intersection of life and Nature, which is the breath.

## Breath as carrier of vibrations

> Mark: How does conscious breathing help in developing one’s behavioral intelligence?
>
> James: Well, let’s say I practice Quantum Pause, and while I’m breathing, I become conscious of the new spacetime I’m in—that unique part of the universe that my local universe intersects with in that exact moment. I choose to breathe in the feelings of compassion. Every breath I inhale, I imagine it to be compassion, which is to say that any in-breath can be imbued with virtue. I summon it to my human instrument and let it saturate me like an internal waterfall.
>
> …You could be in a jail cell or a villa in the south of France, the spacetime that intersects your local universe can be modified by you. You are the alchemist. The creator. You can use your imaginative power to imbue your in-breath with a virtue like compassion, forgiveness, humility, valor, understanding, joy, love, whatever you would like. You’re the creator, and the new spacetime is your canvas.
>
> The new energy fields that flow through you are carriers, and as they sweep through your local universe—your energy field—they carry it to others, and the distance they’re carried is not bound to earth or limited.

The breath is a very versatile carrier of vibrations into the body. Through the work of imagination, memory, and feeling, it is possible to summon desired vibrational frequencies with ease through the inbreath, and then distribute them through the outbreath.

## Specific techniques

With time, one can design specific techniques that use the breath as central point. One such technique described is the [Quantum Moment](https://write.as/l9lj6ft2m3ox33ko.md).

Another is the [Rising Heart][rising-heart]:

> As the children of light begin to activate their light bodies while living within a human instrument, they will sense the presence of their electromagnetic field as it becomes enmeshed with their every breath. The breath washes over the Rising Heart in both the in-breath and out-breath. When breathing in, the energy symbolically descends from the Central Sun and flows through the crown chakra settling at the solar plexus just below the heart. There, it sparkles in the golden light of your signature tone. When breathing out, the energy is released from the solar plexus up to the planetary axis at the height of the thymus or Rising Heart, and then radiates outward with dominance to the horizontal plane.

While this is just the brief description of the technique, it is recommended to read [the whole paper][rising-heart] on it to properly understand its purpose.

Below are listed some of the examples of such uses of the breath charged with Heart Virtues. There are definitely more, and I would encourage people to find/construct and share such techniques, so that they can be properly distributed, and possibly added to this document.

### Breath of Appreciation

> It is for this reason that when the human instrument projects gratitude to the Universal Entity, regardless of circumstance or condition, life becomes increasingly supportive in opening the human instrument to activate its Source Codes and live life within the framework of the synthesis model of expression. The feeling of gratitude coupled with the mental concept of appreciation is expressed like an invisible message in all directions and at all times. In this particular context, gratitude to the Universal Entity is the overarching motive behind all forms of expression that the human instrument aspires to.
>
> Every breath, every word, every touch, every thought, every thing is centered on expressing this sense of gratitude. A gratitude that the individual is sovereign and supported by a Universal Entity that expresses itself through all forms and manifestations of intelligence with the sole objective of creating the ideal reality to activate the individual’s Source Codes and transform the human instrument and entity into the Sovereign Integral. It is this specific form of gratitude that accelerates the activation of the Source Codes and their peculiar ability to integrate the disparate componentry of the human instrument and the entity, and transform them to the state of perception and expression of the Sovereign Integral.


### Breath of Compassion

> Any complex organism, or machine for that matter, requires a period of rest. The rest is a way to reset the build-up of system stressors that result from incoming information overload and physical energyy loss or entropy. The heart accumulates these sterssors from the perceptual lens of the mind and body throughtout the waking period. These stressors add density to the heard region, which, like fog, can obscure the heart's vision of understanding, and thus, its expression of compassion -- that most cherished of all qualities.
>
> The heart is a processing center of the mind-body. It absorbs the stressors and densities of human emotion, but over time, it needs to reset itself. It needs to reclaim its clarity, coherence and compassion. The heart both accumulates and stores energies, and it also transmits them through an electromagneic field that is not bound by linear spacetime.
>
> The best technique to reset the heart is to allow neutrality to flow in all spaces of your presence. This is how you do it.
>
> Close your eyes. Take a few deep, centering beraths and as you breathe imagine that the space that cradles your heart becomes active. You can feel warmth in that region. You can place your hands over your heart. However you are led, feel this warmth as a cleansing energy, and hold it for as long as you can, eveny if only for a moment in time. If you can, give this warmth the color of a vibrant green -- the kind you see in deep, primeval forests.
>
> Now, as you feel this green, warm energy, allow it to drift upwards into your head, and then open your eyes and see the world through your heart. See it as if your were looking with your heart and not merely your eye-brain system. This is the reset. This is how you know when you have been successful, for you will see the exterior of your world as though is were a mirror of compassion.


### Preath of Forgiveness

> Student: Okay, so how does this all relate to clearing the emotional debris that’s been inscribed upon my heart?
>
> Teacher: It is not the heart itself that it has been inscribed upon. The emotional debris is passed from the heart to the brain and the neural network that surrounds it. Thus the clearing takes the same route and is a process, not an event.
>
> It begins with the compassion frequency of the emotion called forgiveness. This frequency can be evoked within your heart through this command:
>
> As the light of my heart brightens, so does my capacity to forgive. As forgiveness flows into my heart it moves upwards, filling my entire head with the most delicate and refined light imaginable, and from this light, a compassion for my past settles in, and all that has occurred is rewritten in this light.
>
> While this invocation is being said, you can listen carefully to the words and allow them to form visual pictures in your heart.
>
> Student: That’s interesting. I’ve always been taught to form pictures in my mind, but never in my heart.
>
> Teacher: Visualization is not confined to a specific position in the body or head. It can be placed anywhere by projection. Simply project the pictures to the area in the center of your chest. The one who views the projection can be outside of your body watching from a distance of a few meters.
>
> Student: Who is watching outside my body?
>
> Teacher: You are.

### Breath of Understanding

> “Listen to your breath. Do you hear it flow through your body?”
>
> She nodded after a few moments. “Yes, I hear it.”
>
> The field they were in was completely quiet, and the sound of her breath, other than when the bird spoke, was the only sound she could hear.
>
> The bird’s voice was only a whisper. “Follow the breath to your heart and allow it to settle there, and when you do, imagine the breath is your soul, or spirit. Can you do that?”
>
> “I will try,” she answered.
>
> The Oracle took deep breaths and imagined that the air was her soul, and as she breathed in, she would let it gather in the area of her heart.
>
> “Now,” the bird continued, “try to add one feeling to the breath, just one feeling. Bring in the feeling of understanding.”
>
> “What is that feeling?” the Oracle asked inquisitively. “I know understanding as an analytical concept, but not as a feeling.”
>
> “Understanding is a feeling. It is not a thing of the mind. It is an awareness of love’s significance in your life, and why love matters more than any other thing. Bring this feeling into your breath and allow it to activate your heart like a promising fire being kindled in the wilderness with utter care and diligence.”
>
> The Oracle, her eyes closed, concentrated on the words, then her breath, and then the feeling of understanding. She could feel a change take place somewhere within her, but she couldn’t define it. She sensed a movement into a timeless place. It was a place of forgiveness that she had never entered before.
