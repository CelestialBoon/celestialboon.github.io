This guide is intended to acquaint the practitioner in energy work with particular types of energy, those of divine Love, for use in their practice and in their life; dealing in how to perceive it, receive it, use it, share it; and grow in mastery of the practice, and perfect your life through its use. <!-- more -->

## A brief introduction

Energy work is a line of magick operating from the conceptual basis that reality is made of energy and matter, and matter is energy, and energy is vibrations; and thus, reality is vibrations.  
The interplay of vibrations shapes the entirety of existence, effectively, and the observation of change in the patterns of reality is translated into perception of forces and energy at play.  

Through energy work, which is learning to perceive and manipulate the subtle energies (ie. those that compose the aura, the energy body, the energy streams, the elemental energies, and such), the practice allows one a more fine control of the unsubtle energies (ie. the more physical ones).  
It is speculated that the subtle energies are what is now being recognized from the scientific current as dark energy/matter.

These vibrations, these energies, are distinguishable by their signatures, their frequencies, much like instruments have not just the ability to play different tones, but have a distinct timbre, a collection of overtones and undertones that gives their sound a recognizable texture.  
In the same way, energies have their base frequency and a timbre, more or less complex, that distinguishes them from all others.  
Examples of different vibrational signatures would be the elements (of pretty much any system), the healing energy streams, the various emotions that people give off, etc.

For accomplishing tasks with them, energy workers are usually practiced in perceiving such energies, discerning them, moving them around, growing or diminishing the presence of any one type, transmuting them from a frequency to another, and/or shaping them into something more elaborate and complex.

Some types of energy are becoming increasingly present and accessible in recent times, and those are of the frequencies of divine Love.

> "Space is intersected by energies from galaxies, stars, planets, moons, and various cosmic events, as well as the Creator's Presence. Space is anything but empty; it's the conductor of energies, and just like our blood circulates oxygen to our body, space circulates energies to planets like earth. This circulation is not haphazard or random, or an expression of chaos, no, it is perfectly intelligent.
>
> "However, the intelligence is an expression of ratios. The Creator's Presence meets resistance in certain corridors of space that are less prepared for its higher frequencies, and in these areas, the energies of the elementals—planets, stars and galaxies—dominate. But since everything in spacetime is dynamic, always changing, the ratio of the Creator's Presence to the elementals is also changing.
>
> "We just happen to be in the spacetime when the ratio shifts... and this means that each of us will breathe in a higher ratio of the Creator's Presence."
>
And in such a context, this guide is for the practictioner to grow familiar with those frequencies, and learn how to harness them for maximum effect.

## So what is Divine Love?

> 'And still, after all this time, the Sun never says to the Earth, "You owe me." Look what happens with a love like that. It lights the whole sky.' — Hafiz

Divine Love has been termed in the past with names such as selfless love, or agape, or metta. Those are the energies commonly associated with the acts of unconditional love, of nurturing care, of loving kindness, of humble understanding.

More than that, it is a powerful force of unification, a divine intelligence that sustains existence, life, and its innate movement towards expansion and integration. It is effectively, the texture of the One Intelligence that fills the Universe. It is the Universe's lifeblood. It is, by way of purity, the Presence of the One Creator manifested in the worlds of creation. It is the language that our Soul whispers to us in.

> And this picture is what we call love, and yet when people sling this word around in their everyday life, it is absent this meaning. It is another thing altogether, and so the first thing one learns on the heart’s path, is to redefine love as the nectar of the undefinable.

## How does this Divine Love work?

> “When Uncle put his arm down he spoke. He told the anthropologist that he had listened to her spirit. It had told him the same story that the wolf had.
>
> “She was lonely. She lived in fear. She was tired of being depressed. Her spirit was waiting to be seen. To be rediscovered. To be allowed the chance to love again, but there was a blockage. The anthropologist was not able to release something. It was something related to a man who had mistreated her …a relationship that had begun with such perfect hopes and then slowly descended into mistrust and fear.
>
> “Uncle stood up and gathered the woman’s hands and pulled her to her feet. By this time, the anthropologist was awestruck at what Uncle had said and confirmed in her expression that he was correct. He had taken her hands and folded them over her heart, and told her to close her eyes, and imagine one thing, one simple thing when she was a child: her mother’s touch when she had forgiven her as a child. The anthropologist did as she was instructed, and soon I could see her body trembling. Uncle told her to take this feeling and give it to the man that had wronged her, and to feel as if the wrong, no matter how cruel it had felt at the time, had been resolved.
>
> “After about three minutes, she opened her eyes and she gave Uncle a huge hug. She laughed nonstop that night as we talked unscripted from that point forward. She wrote her book, but the book wasn’t about Lakota spirituality. It was all about the importance of forgiveness in relationships.  

Divine Love is made of frequencies that resonate most easily within the Heart, as in, the heart chakra, or the energetic heart, in the chest area.  
They are channeled from the One Intelligence, by your higher self, or Soul, into the heart region, in order to be felt, used, and distributed.

The divine Love crystallizes from the higher realms into the worlds of form, shaping itself through the prism of the Heart into particular frequencies of expression, both of feeling and of behaviour.  
In order for their potency to be fully manifested, there is coherency to cultivate between the Love that is felt and that which is expressed, both inwards and outwards. *Doing things with feeling*, as they say.

The **six Heart Virtues** which are the main frequencies of divine Love are:

- **Appreciation**: From the realization that we are connected at the deepest level in a framework that unifies us and our individual purposes in Love, appreciation is expressed in the gestures of gratitude that birth and support relationships and bonding.

- **Compassion** is the active desire to assist in the alignment with the uplifting and liberating frequencies of Love, aware that their desire and ability to align is distorted by their social enculturation; it does not accurately reflect their intelligence, spiritual inclinations, or purpose. 

- **Forgiveness**: From the understanding that every person is doing the best that they can under current circumstances, and the compassion to help them move past mistakes and help them recenter in the present moment, forgiveness is an act of acceptance and release, freeing selves from the quicksand of time, of being stuck contemplating the past.  
It is the realization that if our limitations make us prone to mistakes and flawed decisions, those same limitations make us unable to properly judge actions and choices from an encompassing view; thus, we cannot judge, and so we forgive.

- **Humility** is the realization that the whole system of experience intermingles in a framework of divine Love, and is supported by it. Humility is the expression of these divine energies, with the knowing that the virtues of the heart, the pure intellect of the contemplative mind, and the co-creative pursuits of the heart, mind, and soul derive from what already exists in a higher dimension, where all are One, all are Equal, all are Divine, and all are Immortal.

- **Understanding**: While our core energetic structure is that of soul, composed of frequencies of pure Love, and the sheaths of density and form are means to experience it and express it, nonetheless those sheaths (the human instrument) creates feelings of separation and disconnection from our inner divinity and from all life.
Understanding is the aspect of heart intelligence that recognizes that this dissociation from Love is a necessary design component of the larger blueprint, that unravels through time, even as different people are at different stages of the unraveling.

- **Valor** is the transmission of spiritual values in the face of separation. It is the acting against injustice, in defense of the presence of Love, and it is the transmission of such values and understandings to those not in the frequency of Unity, in a nonjudgmental way.

For a more detailed explanation of the heart virtues, you can consult [this excerpt from *Living from the Heart*](https://write.as/c9z2kncjhhvljc17.md).

Those frequencies are continuously received from the constant stream that Soul outpours. They are always available, and with practice, a clearer pathway can be established for a more vibrant and vital connection to them.  
They can be studied, contemplated, felt, learned, expressed, developed, and ultimately mastered.


## What does it do?

> If you do it enough times, you will see that the direction is stillness and allowance and acceptance and love.
>
> It is not a direction of space or time. It is not really a direction at all. It is the persistent attitude of forgiveness; the wisdom of opening yourself to what finds you; the allowance of Life in your life. It is the outflow of love as the defining principle of your life. This is why the heart, when activated, does not seek. It absorbs. It expresses. It heals even when it cannot heal the body or mind. It heals because it raises its light in symphony to the one presence that wrote the program. And the agglomeration of all other ills, densities, injustices is seen in this same light as the program. The heart is the light that activates the picture of what we are — collectively.  
>
> And this picture is what we call love, and yet when people sling this word around in their everyday life, it is absent this meaning. It is another thing altogether, and so the first thing one learns on the heart’s path, is to redefine love as the nectar of the undefinable.

Love is a force of unification and integration. It is a movement of understanding, and acting from that understanding to reconcile, to bring together, to mend, to integrate; to synthesize.

Those are energies that can be channeled to heal and transform, to enliven and enlighten. They bring the possibility of one's highest expression, and they guide life towards that expression.

They are a force that is nurturing of life; that cultivates the best conditions, and that supports one's growth, development, and transformation.

One way that this is very observable is how they can be used to transmute emotions, in self and others, towards more uplifting, understanding, open, creative ones.  
For example, anger is a strong emotion of othering, of recognizing a rift between your vision and reality that screams to be corrected somehow, and that brings a lot of energy with it. The virtues of Love can assist its transformation into a clean reassessment of reality, and a positive shift in worldviews, and the use of such energies to externalize such transformation in a coherent way.


## Why should one use it?

> Joseph smiled. "Can you teach me how to slow down the aging process?"
>
> "You want to live longer?" Simon asked shaking his head. "Are you sure? I'd suggest to live as long as you breathe, and not a moment longer."
> Joseph stopped pouring water. "I was being serious."
>
> "Serious enough I suppose," Simon replied, "but seriousness has never been a key to unlock the mysteries."
>
> "Then what is?" Maia asked, overhearing the conversation.
>
> Simon swept an assortment of sliced vegetables and roots into a large wooden bowl, and poured something over the mixture that looked like honey. "It has less to do with the expression of your intellect, willpower, or endeavoring to absorb the wisdom of the ages; and more to do with the indivisible entity that rules in the quiet of your every breath.
>
> "This entity is the Creator's Presence formulated inside your body and mind here on earth, but its native world is without the structures of spacetime, and for this reason, this indivisible entity is not conditioned by spacetime as your body and mind are. Because it lacks this indoctrination, it simply observes, without judgment; it navigates without a goal; it guides without ego; it co-creates without possession."
>
> Simon sat down opposite Maia at the table, and looked directly into her eyes. "It is this entity within you that is your true Presence and it is the only key that unlocks the mysteries. No amount of seriousness or devotion will produce any result if this entity isn't first called into action."

I find that the main reasons for the practice of divine Love are two-fold.

### For those that wish to help

As the energies of divine Love are manifesting more plainly with time, there is a growing perception of the natural movement of the Universe towards nurturing and supporting the creatures in it; towards providing them with what they need for their evolution.  

One can become a part of this caring, a part of this nurturing, by expressing that very same Love into our lives, and sharing it with ourselves and others, and eventually, everything that we meet. It is becoming a part of a larger whole that operates in harmony and unison. A whole that possesses a vast and powerful intelligence, which can be contemplated, accessed, dialogued with (if not exactly through words), and of course, shared.  

It is the primary pathway of cocreation with the whole Universe, for Love is the texture of what unifies us, and what sends us forward together. It is the Universe sharing the ways of advancement, and of joyful and purposeful living with Itself. Once you access it and act in resonance with it, you are effectively acting as One with Everything.

### For those in search of their true selves

The act of developing and transmitting Love is severly transformative, and it the clearest pathway that I know towards realizing your true, deepest, infinite self. Love can guide you towards unveiling yourself, not only to others, but to yourself as well. When the layers of deception are peeled away, what remains is just the presence of you.

The practice of divine Love brings you closer to your divine Self, to the point that it allows this divine Self, the Soul, to effectively be fully embodied in this life as result. Through reaching emotional self-mastery and the continuous expression of divine Love, you can live as Soul on Earth.

## How does one use it?

> “At first, when I was told that I should prepare my heart, I thought it was an instruction to lead a clean, simple life, exercise a lot, pay attention to my diet and so forth, but I was wrong. It was about cultivating the frequencies of love within my heart, and holding it there and releasing it whenever I could.
>
> “I never studied any of the religions of this world… never had an interest. I focused on my heart instead. I studied it. I listened to it. I found all of the frequencies that it resonated to, and I learned how these frequencies could be woven into practices that created connections between the heart and brain and the mind and body.
>
> “Someone with deep emotion—not the sentimental, mushy kind, but the kind that is lucid, fused from a deep and abiding love that’s not moody or predicated on ease— can arouse their missions, even missions as grand as yours. The heart is the fuel that powers the mission.”

There's many levels to the practice, for sure. In a way, one can use such energies to permeate and fill every aspect of their lives. The practice is more of a *how* than a *what*.

### The practice

As first step, it helps to actively imagine attracting those energies in your life, through means of visualization and/or belief; to envision growing a lasting, clear, and vibrant connection between you and them, so that the reception of them will come easily, even through the adversities and distractions of life.  
They are the primal energies of the Universe of Wholeness, so you can also hold the intent to be aligned with Its will, the will of the One Intelligence that fills It, and that orchestrates the whole dance.

As second step, the breath is a vital tool of recentering, and of reconnecting with the stillness that is at your core, and from which these virtues flow.

> "Listen to your breath. Do you hear it flow through your body?"
>
> She nodded after a few moments. "Yes, I hear it."
>
> The field they were in was completely quiet, and the sound of her breath, other than when the bird spoke, was the only sound she could hear.
>
> The bird's voice was only a whisper. "Follow the breath to your heart and allow it to settle there, and when you do, imagine the breath is your soul, or spirit. Can you do that?"
>
> "I will try," she answered.
>
> The Oracle took deep breaths and imagined that the air was her soul, and as she breathed in, she would let it gather in the area of her heart.
>
> "Now," the bird continued, "try to add one feeling to the breath, just one feeling. Bring in the feeling of understanding."
>
> "What is that feeling?" the Oracle asked inquisitively. "I know understanding as an analytical concept, but not as a feeling."
>
> "Understanding is a feeling. It is not a thing of the mind. It is an awareness of love's significance in your life, and why love matters more than any other thing. Bring this feeling into your breath and allow it to activate your heart like a promising fire being kindled in the wilderness with utter care and diligence."
>
> The Oracle, her eyes closed, concentrated on the words, then her breath, and then the feeling of understanding. She could feel a change take place somewhere within her, but she couldn't define it. She sensed a movement into a timeless place. It was a place of forgiveness that she had never entered before.

Concerning the actual use of them, you can of course, bring them to energy work. They can be used as the energies for healing; they can be used in group meditation in lieu of the energies to send (compassion in particular is often called for in such endeavors). It can be the primary energies we exhude in an environment. It can be our ways of communication in spirit work, since every encounter is really an energy exchange. It can be the stuff of emotional magic, like when you could influence the mood of a room or situation by transmuting its energies very directly. More in general, such energies can be sent wherever there's a call for them to, which usually is felt from a lack of one heart virtue of other in the situation.

In particular, such energies offer themselves eagerly to the treatment of self; to offer understanding, and forgiveness, and healing, and surpassment of old paradigms, and learning of new lessons, and clearing of blockages and densities, and healing of old scars and new wounds. For example, one technique that exemplifies the clearing of densities is the [Neutral Heart](https://write.as/g7n4jtnngfe4lpat.md).

Those frequencies can be studied, contemplated in the quiet of meditation, and their relationship with yourself examined and studied, in order to further your understanding of them, and your connection to them.

And, they can be expressed in the various acts, thoughts and feelings of the daily life. It is there to be used, and shared. Every situation can be saturated with divine Love, in support of the highest expression of everyone in the moment. Every act can be understood, and through compassion for self and others, forgiven, and appreciated. Joy can be found in the discovery of beauty and wholeness in all things. Situations can be navigated through the guidance and expression of such higher intelligence.

Through the practice, one can become an emotional alchemist.

> Mark: What do mean an alchemist?
>
> James: If your human instrument is fear-based, locked in the rigidity of the left, reptilian brain, you’re more likely to broadcast fear, insecurity and depression—for example. These emotions are a form of energy and, like all energy, they are conserved. In a sense, energy is never created, it is transformed or recycled. I can take energy that is dense and closed, and I can transform it to an energy that is opening to the frequency of love. I can be an alchemist of energy, and instead of trying to turn iron into gold, I turn anger into kindness… or depression into interconnection… or indifference into compassion.
>
> Energy then informs matter. Energy is many things by human standards… it can be physical energy used to produce something like work or to play a sport. It can be emotional energy that deals with love or anger. It can be a mental energy that helps us solve a problem or capitalize on an opportunity. It can be spiritual energy that activates and sustains our interest in the culture of soul.
>
> These different types of energies have different frequencies. Some are condensed energies that are heavy—in a sense. Some are light. We’ve all felt these different energetic fields in rooms or public spaces or… or nature, and we’ve all felt them within ourselves. Sometimes we’re buoyant and joyful, and the energy—at least emotionally—is light and easy. Other times we’re heavy with disappointment or fear or frustration. We feel these energies. They’re not abstractions to us… or words on paper. They have a visceral reality in our local universe.
>
> Being an alchemist is being able to transform energy. To shift energy. Not to let densities build up and calcify, because these are the things that weigh us down, and make our abilities to be alchemists for ourselves and others more difficult.

The frequencies of divine Love are the highest expressible, and [gratitude in particular](https://celestialboon.github.io/consciousness/2018/08/03/universe-days-of-i-am.html) can reshape our relationship with the Universe at large, creating a relationship that is open, trusting, vital, transformative, and deeply, continuously loving and cocreative.

By growing closer to these energies, one might just find themselves emanating them passively, for they are always received, and there only needs to be the intent to release them as they come, transparently.

> **Emanate**. When the Spiritual Center (Ed. Soul) is found, however dim or vivid your connection might be, it will flow through your human instrument. You will emanate its frequencies only when you adopt its perspectives. If you try to bottle its energetic flow into human mind paradigms of greed, separation, polarity, or control, it will dissolve its connection. This dissolution can take minutes or months, it depends on a complex set of factors, but it will not be subject to the mind.
>
> Emanation is the goal of the spiritual activist. It is the quiet, unobtrusive frequency of equality and oneness. It is the tone of equality that flows from this Spiritual Center and nothing else is required. There is no struggle or effort to amp it up, or send it this way or that. It is transmitted without effort and there is no time-switch or channel through which it flows. It permeates the human instrument as a vibratory frequency and is released into the local universe like a perfume’s scent that flows in every direction, taken up by the wind and circulated throughout the Universe.
