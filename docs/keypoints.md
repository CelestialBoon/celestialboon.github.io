# Some key points

<br>

As first point, there is the concept of the world of form, of appearances, as maya:
- as a fundamental illusion, much like a dream is an illusion that is still very real to our senses.
- as the ongoing creation of the One Mind, which is individuated into separate points of view.

It follows that all things, all beings are thoughtforms, and are inherently alive, since all is One, and that One is very much alive. Ergo, animism.

The focus on shamanism and tulpamancy springs from the desire to provide tools to explore this angle, this shape of Creation, that I've found working best for some modern seekers, including myself.

The second point would be that consciousness is the true composition of the Self.

The Self is, first and foremost, an individuated consciousness; it is the consciousness of the One Creator that has been cast into multiple points of view that each of us are. By the process of being conscious of things, such consciousnesses effectively create reality as observed.
It follows that particular focus should be placed on studying, examining such consciousness, and ways of altering it, for it effectively is what creates reality. From this reason comes the creation of channels dedicated to meditation, and entheogens, and other such ways of altering and observing diversified states of consciousness.

also there's the fractality that brings metaphors and comparisons and models meaning
as above so below
as within so without
self-similarity adn connection (which can even be thought as one and the same) that allows us to think in those terms

The third point would be the natural tendency of the Universe towards complexification, unification, compression of information. Terence McKenna called it novelty, and the tendency towards concrescence.

It is also astractable as the tendency of all separate expressions to reunite with the unitary consciousness of the One Creator. It is observable in the motion of the Universe from energy to atoms to molecules to cells to multicellular beings to ecosystems to societies, and this is still ongoing of course. Greater and greater complexity, unification, connection.

This motion is guided by a force, the unification force, that pervades all of Creation, through the distributed presence of the pure consciousness of the One Creator inside of Its creation. It is what some call the Holy Spirit, or Source Intelligence, or Intelligent Infinity, the Aether, the quantum vacuum, the zero-point energy field, the Higgs Field; really, there's plenty of names for it.

And this force is of course, harnessable. One can align to this motion of the Universe and channel such force through one's being and actions. The best way I've heard it described is in the Wingmakers materials, under the name of Divine Love.

As much as the name would imply otherwise, it is a force that transcends good and evil, and ultimately acts towards understanding of the disparate parts and their confluence into a common synthesis. It is the reunification of the dualities into a new unity.

More in general, this movement causes expansion of consciousness, which is a close approximation to the actual end-goal of things. Through the accumulation of experiences and distillation of wisdom, and the reunion of the disparate evolved viewpoints into the Whole, the One Creator allows Itself to grow and expand Its personality.

In particular, the Wingmakers materials is what I've found describing all this in the most clarifying manner, not only through straight philosophy, but also providing experiential frameworks, and media that is designed to be catalyzing, allowing the careful student of such materials to rapidly shift their consciousness into awareness of their greater Self.
