So I've been reading [The Continuum Concept](http://continuum-concept.org/book.html), by Jean Liedloff, and it's been entirely mind-blowing. The continuum is a very enlightening spin on factors such as trauma and neglect, and something we should all keep dearly in mind when dealing with people, especially ourselves.

The continuum is a broad container for a species' adaptations to the environment. which are also expectations! Just like lungs are an adaptation to air, they are also an *expectation* of air. Nature, being relatively stable long-term, allows such demands from living beings.

Naturally, the continuum not only is a crucial part of a creature's life, but also of its development: the instinct to reach for the mother's teats in mammalians and suck is temporary, but fundamental for both life and growth.

In the book, Jean elucidates on a fundamental betrayal of the human continuum: as infants, we are not embraced 24/7; our needs go unmet; our cries unanswered. The love we need, the Presence, the Tightness, the participation to adult life that we expect, are not there.

Instead, we are left in cots while we instinctively scream and cry, denouncing the betrayal of our continuum. We are not made passive observers to adult life, which would help us integrate into society. We are treated as fragile beings and just held far away from everything.

Part of the human continuum goes beyond instinct and well into imprinting, just like an animal imprints on its "mother" at birth. A human is primed to absorb the expectations, behaviors, and culture surrounding them, making it all part of their instinctual behaviour.

But what happens when the love we *expect* to receive gets denied? Through the large blunders of our caretakers, we learn that we are not loved; that our cries go unheard; that people will not fulfill our basic needs. This becomes part of our core expectations about the world.

A human, which could naturally become seamlessly integrated in a collaborative society, by this treatment becomes anti-social, and anti-self. Society treats them wrong, but a kid cannot conceive of that. At that age, their continuum expects to be exposed to the *right* ways.

So the alternative is that it is the kid that must somehow be wrong. And this sense of wrongness, of alienation, can stick with people for a lifetime, never letting them feel truly part of something larger, without creeping doubts, without fears, without worries.

Worse still, people conditioned in this manner will *actively* resist any and all events that would destabilize conditions similar to their early treatment (including for the better!!!), specifically because the continuum expects to be exposed in infancy to optimal conditions!

This leads to people endlessly repeating cycles of misery, subconsciously dragging themselves each and every time back to situations that they claim to not want (abusive partners, poverty, rejection etc.)

There is a certain quality that the use of certain psychoactives (especially psychedelics) bestows on the user. It is something both instinctively felt as right and vital, and often also left nameless, for lack of the mind's ability to easily grasp the primal.

Some others do put a name to it, and it is Love. The endless acceptance, and Rightness, and welcoming embrace that is felt as such a matter of course during a trip as to be beyond obvious, surrounding them like water to a fish.

It is this Love that many high-chasers and addicts pursue, even when unable to pinpoint their longing and primal need. It is their continuum calling to pick up things where they were left off, for receiving the requirements for further development.

Thankfully, in such matters, our continuum can just delay matters pretty much indefinitely, in wait for the hole of our needed experiences to be filled, which is admittedly the salvation of many stranded contemporary souls.

I've found a key concept in meditation that I haven't seen stressed enough, and it is that in meditation, specifically to fill this hole, one should focus first and foremost on *feeling content just for being alive*.

It is specifically this unconditional acceptance from the world, which does not depend on what we did or do, what we think or thought, what we look like, on what we are, that many of us did not get when it was called for, and now must provide ourselves.

It is this quiet joy for *just existing* that we need to fill ourselves with, and that we can summon through the most basic acceptance of ourselves, and of life. Quiet, meditative, loving moments are a wonderful opportunity to gradually fill our quotas.

This is but the most basic summary+elaboration upon Jean Liedloff's work - I *cannot* recommend enough that people familiarize with her work. It can easily be life-changing, and not just for readers, but for their kids.
