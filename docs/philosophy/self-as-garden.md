Basically think of yourself as a garden - you find out that you've been piling up garbage in it from the outside, and the first step (they blend, but still) is removing the garbage (unlearning conditioning, healing trauma). That leaves the garden mostly empty, ideally.

The next step is both letting the garden grow, and learning how to care for the garden: how to *not* let any more garbage in, and how to dispose of it and recover once it does; it's seeing what really was available to you, deep within, and shaping it gently into a new self.

The more you free up space, the more what's natural to you (deep stirrings, callings, talents) will have space to develop, as long as you give them the chance to do so (which is a surprisingly non-forced process! It's exploring your whims and playing around)

Basically it amounts to taking care of yourself by keeping yourself clean (physically, but also mentally, so learning to avoiding unnecessary turmoil etc. and emotionally, so navigating the emotional landscape) and giving your self the sunlight of awareness.
