Just realized that Italian has a single word (desiderio) for both desire and wish. With the funny implication that the English-speaker could possibly wish for something that they don't desire, which doesn't only sound absurd, but is linguistically disallowed in Italian.

This is likely the first instance I recognize where a language might be doing it wrong by having too many words, and somehow splitting in two a concept that shouldn't. Desire as what you *feel* you want, wish as what you *express* that you want.

Which brings me to the realization that perhaps any such split in language between something that we feel and something that we express fosters such a split, promoting an ability to eg. express falsehoods (which can inevitably turn back on oneself and trap the user into lies)

Many words are of course confusing and overloaded with meanings, though this is the first time I find myself actually contesting a discrimination of meanings on principle.

"want", of course, being yet another word, overloaded in its own confusing ways

It reminds me of the body-mind split that we are so fond of in Western culture, and how this conception in fact encourages to model such a split, and thus to actualize it in word and deed. It's easy to imagine a simpler culture in which this split is a foreign thought.

A society without a mind-body split could easily be more embodied, knowing indeed that they think, feel, act with their whole bodymind, but would probably have an harder time with deception, since they might not have a strong concept of actually being able to hide things inside.

Having the innate concept that lies also hide something from yourself would bring them closer to truth, since this is true of all lying; to tell a lie, one has to first model it, and thus take it as truth, even if for a small while.

i wonder if in such a culture, hiding something from others would imply hiding it just as much from oneself?
