Meditation is inviting your demons to enjoy existence together with you.

Heart is substance, Mind is style.

There is no coming to consciousness without pain. 

- Carl G. Jung

In the same way an arm might tingle and hurt as we return feeling in it, so expanding our consciousness can meet pain, for pain might be what stopped us from staying aware of it in the first place. Sometimes the way out is through.


I'm gonna have to expand on this. To staple money onto a system is to effectively transplant capitalism to it.

Capitalism is our biggest case of Goodhart's Law on Earth, and as long as we keep putting the focus on currency as some magical proxy for value, this will continue.


Nostalgia is longing for feelings, not things or events. 

If you feel nostalgic, focus your attention on the feelings associated with the memory, not the contents, to understand.


The wave/particle duality, but for other dualities

"Suchness is neither that which is existence, nor that which is nonexistence, nor that which is at once existence and nonexistence, nor that which is not at once existence and nonexistence." - Ashvaghosha

When asked what the secret of his angelic poetry was, Blake said: "Attend the minute particulars." That's all. Focus attention in the moment. DO not betray attention into expectation borne of abstraction,  or regret borne of misplaced assumption, or remembrance borne of boredom and alienation in the moment. Attend the minute particulars as a kind of practice. - Terence McKenna

I think I've figured out my beef with Eckhart Tolle's premise. It's that Presence, awareness, isn't the magic cure-all because there are many kinds of consciousness. Being judgmentally observant of something will do little to help it shift.

It's only the spacious, allowing awareness; the Consciousness of God, as it's sometime called; the Divine Love that is the eternal and nonjudgmental witness, that really creates the space for something to change. The loving embrace that accepts all that is, and all transformation



I don't know if I'll ever stop being surprised at the mountainous power of metaphors to convey new meaning to people in an immediate, intuitive way. Feels like actual spells woven amidst of communication.

There is no end to the collective call of recovering myth and stories as our primary means of meaning-building, because they're just so damn immediate. They fit so innately to the mind's workings that trying to get meaning across any other way looks like childish foolishness.


"The older I got, the more flavorless became the little satisfactions that life gave me; and the more clearly I understood where I were to find the source of joy in life.

I learned that being loved is nothing, while loving is everything, and gradually I came to understand that what fills our existence with value and pleasure is nothing but our capacity to feel.

Wherever I could make out on Earth something that would be called "happiness", it consisted of sensation. Money was nothing; power was nothing. I saw many that had both and were unhappy. Beauty was nothing: I saw beautiful men and women that were unhappy despite their own beauty.

Not even health counted for much; everyone rather lived their own perception of health, and there were ill ones filled with will to live, that blossomed right up to just before the end, and there were healthy ones wilting in anxiety over fear of suffering.

But happiness was everywhere a person would have strong feelings, and would live for them, without pushing them away, or doing them violence, but instead cultivating them and enjoying them. Beauty would not appease those who had it, but those who knew how to love it and adore it.

There were seemingly countless feelings, but really they were a single thing. You can give that feeling any name, like Will. I call it Love. Happiness is love, and nothing else. Happy is the one who knows how to love.

Love is every movement of our soul feeling itself and feeling life. But loving and desiring are not the same thing. Love is Desire made wise. Love doesn't seek to have; Love only seeks to love."

--Herman Hesse, On Love


I'm just so mad at the default option of just telling people to go to therapy. Literally the equivalent of telling them to go buy a lottery ticket if they want to get rich
