So something quite interesting happened this meditation session. I was stuck combating against the body-mind system's aversion (through drowsiness) to explore bad states, and it stuck me that I was doing something wrong. Was this equanimity training? What was I doing?

What IS equanimity? Just being indistinctly open to suffering sounds senseless. I was doing that when I was a baby, and it left me with trauma, so clearly there's more to it than that. I can't just put my system through bad shit and expect what, compliance? For it not to rebel?

So while I was wondering I was unexpectedly brought food, and since it was best hot I just started eating it then and there, not breaking posture. Already the whole thing was decidedly more pleasant, which made me wonder about the point. And then the realization came.

I had been stuck into forcing myself through unpleasant situations (this has happened in dreams as well) in order to grow, in that kind of "misery builds character" philosophy, but I realized that this was an artifact passed down by my parents, and not the natural way of things.

So after that, I just spent the session in an open mic night sort of way. Instead of deliberately seeking things, just letting the parts of me come up as they pleased, in an environment of acceptance. And that went a load better, AND it was definitely more pleasant. Playful.

So I'm finding myself reevaluating equanimity. It exists in this weird space between our immortal self, all-accepting, and the body, which is our vehicle of duality. It clearly doesn't make sense at either extreme, but is extremely profound for some inbetween point.

Also there was my anxiety of wanting to record everything that happens, which created this dissociation from present experience, so that also was addressed in this session. Fun times.

Intention-setting continues to blow my mind, besides. Set an intention and if you pay attention, you'll see the pathway to it unfold right in your awareness, inside yourself, piece by piece, up to either realization or the point where fear turns into resistance.

It's like asking something to a master, and having them accompany your movements up to the point where it's either done, or the discomfort has you jerk out of it. One can see it happening, but the student also has to allow new things to happen for new results to emerge.
