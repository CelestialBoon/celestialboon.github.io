I'll start with a dream I had last night.

I've been helping out a friend of mine with math at a sort of community school, and I end up accompanying one of the little girls to the bathroom; there's a line outside it, and while we are waiting for her turn on an [oval radial sofa](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ba/05/25/ba052571ee68249d115cafcf7548653c.jpg), I start to prod her math skills: "How much is one mile in kms?" She gives the right answer after some thought, "So how much is 2 miles in kms?", and she says it's the same amount. "Why is that?", I ask, and she cites some bizarre, because-just-so calculation involving Facebook, and right there I think it's time for a little rant.

Behind us there's a stocked shelf. I point at the black paint jars for miniature painters. They're of a very famous brand, and this particular black it's one I have personally devised in another life as a famous medieval hashishin, but as I show it to her, I explain that the best tools are not only sought after for their quality, or their ease of use; they are NEEDED if the really precise works are to be made AT ALL, and I hand to her a crazy-detailed painted miniature that was laying on a nearby jury shelf-table; it is detailed down to the dust-grain level, including telltale minuscule points of black.

"What we learn and understand is also a tool, and Math is the challenge of reasoning itself; it is the practice of argumentation; it is the art of problem-solving, and if you really take this to heart, if you take this tool and sharpen it, then you'll find yourself reasoning correctly, and thinking the right things, and winning arguments, and in life everyone wants that!  
"Plus, if you wanna do great things, the best tools are required for the cutting-edge works of the era to *have the possibility to be made at all*. We're always claiming new ground in the realm of ideas, and there's nothing like knowing how to reason well that will aid you in the exploration. For this reason, mathematics is fundamental to be practiced, and to be fully appreciated."

At that point I left, to join the tail-end of a large egg-rolling parade, even if I really wanted to wait for her perhaps-inevitable follow-up question: "Okay. What about the other subjects in school?", to which I'd gladly have answered: "LOL, nah, the rest's all worthless, so don't bother. Except English, English is pretty cool; you'll find yourself using English a lot in life." (English as in the second language; we've been discussing in Italian the whole time.)

You may notice that I have some rather funky ideas about what math is about, but that's because the math that is taught in school is rather just a collection of trivia, and not the actual PRACTICE of mathematics. ([Lockhart explains this with a poetry that is truly illuminating.](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf))  
You may also notice that philosophy as taught in school is rather the HISTORY of philosophy, and not the practice itself of DOING philosophy. At no point the students are actually prompted to reason out their observations about life and to figure out conclusions; rather, they are just made to absorb and regurgitate the opinions of other, historically relevant figures, and that's it. That's the whole curriculum.

The exact same disservice is going on with math. *Mathematics is the practice of reasoning about ideas*, which allowed the great mathematicians, as well as a plethora of others, to figure out things about the world of the Abstract; some of these things later turned out to be very important for the rest of us, but that doesn't change that the conclusion that a reasoning reaches is not the reasoning itself. Showing us a painting doesn't teach us how to make one; and in the same way, teaching the conclusions a bunch of mathematicians reached tells us nothing about how to actually come up with our own solutions. 

This is very much of a general pattern, in which the Western school system, instead of teaching us to do, to think, and to make, opts for having us learn what other people did, thought, and made. It's needless to say that this approach is not nearly as effective in educating us as to how to live, instead leaving us submerged in a heap of notions that most teachers barely care about, and that will be mostly useless and forgotten once school is left. 

In doing such, we have lost sight of the core of each discipline, which is vastly more about DOING than it is about knowing what other people did.  
Mathematics is one of the most tragic victims of this mode of thinking, given the modern alienation to the very idea that mathematics could be anything but knowing a bunch of theorems and formulas.

*Mathematics is actually first and foremost a recreational art*, exactly like music. It is the practice of posing ourselves a question in abstract terms and seeing where our reasoning takes us, up to when we reach an answer that SATISFIES us. It is explorative and wondrous; it is the playing around in the realm of ideas. It is the place where thought experiments live.

It is for a reason that Logic, the foundation of rational argument, is a branch of Mathematics; *Mathematics is the art of argument. It is the practice of reasoning*, as abstracted from concrete matters as possible, distilled into the practice itself.

Math is the art of reasoning in the same way that painting is the art of applying color to a surface: while the underlying Action takes place in many more contexts than within the Art, the Art is the practice of doing so while divorced from any immediately-practical aims; it is the skillful application of the Action in order to create something inspiring, appealing and soul-nourishing.  
Art is not the finished piece; *Art is the process of playing in a problem space and finding beauty and wonder in it*.

And just like painting is the art of playing with colors applied to a surface, mathematics is the art of playing with abstract concepts through our reasoning.

To become so distanced from math through the inane process of school indoctrination is to become alienated with the enjoyment of our own thinking. It means becoming alienated with what it means to play-explore the realm of ideas.

School systematically teaches us to forget how to play, in the misguided belief that play is just the stuff of childhood, but in doing so, it commits a criminal act; it disconnects us from our true source of enjoyment and understanding. Without fail, all the great thinkers of the modern era managed what they did because they kept their imagination and their playfulness with them, in spite of school education.

> "Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution." - Albert Einstein

> **"Play is the highest form of research."** - Albert Einstein

Einstein was a school dropout.

> "Nobody ever asks about a simple, ordinary phenomenon in the street. What about those colors? We could have a nice interview, and I could explain all about the colors, butterfly wings, the whole big deal. But you don’t care about that. You want the big final result, and it is going to be complicated because I am at the end of 400 years of a very effective method of finding things out about the world.  
**It has to do with curiosity. It has to do with people wondering what makes something do something.**" - Richard Feynman

> “Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent, and original manner possible.” - Richard Feynman

Feynman had been and endless tinkerer, and taught himself most of the math he'd end up using in his life before school managed to poison it for him.

> "It is as natural for the eye to see as it is for the mind to acquire knowledge, and any effort in either case not only is useless but defeats the end in view. You may force a few facts into a child’s mind by various kinds of compulsion, but you cannot make him learn anything. The facts remain, if they remain at all, as dead lumber in the brain. They contribute nothing to the vital processes of thought, and because they are not acquired naturally and not assimilated, they destroy the natural impulse of the mind toward the acquisition of knowledge. **By the time the child leaves school or college, as the case may be, he not only knows nothing but is, in the majority of cases, no longer capable of learning.**" - William H. Bates 

That people can't manage to learn new things as they become old is no fault of old age itself; the physical potential to learn is with us at all ages, which is plain to see because [people manage to learn new things at all ages](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170828-the-amazing-fertility-of-the-older-mind). Rather, most people simply forget how to learn, something that they innately possessed when younger through their curiosity and their predisposition to play, which get indoctrinated out of them and replaced with the useless baggage of force-fed external 'facts', most of which finds use purely as self-referential trivia, devoid of practical utility.

As a society, we have lost the notion of being playful with the things that matter, and mathematics is but the most egregious example. Through indoctrination, we have deprived ourselves of joy and satisfaction, of meaning, and of the sheer notion of coming to discover our own truths through the effortless exploration of play.

It actually pains me to think that so many people have been turned away from something so powerful, so beautiful, and so important, by the ruse that has been collectively played on us by the school system.

Where are the school courses in how to take care of our body? How to live with our emotions? How to have good discussions? How to have great sex? How to find your life purpose? *Where are the courses in how to live?* Why do we only get garbage while asked to sit still on a chair for hours on end and to obey a person that we have no respect for, which is a pawn of a system that doesn't care for our real needs?  
Why does the system ask us to forget how to play? Why does it hardly ever ask us to doubt, to question, to wonder and to try and to prod and to poke, and to wander and to reach something on our own? Why does it never leave us with the visceral satisfaction of having found out something ourselves?

What does it take for people to see how far off we've gone?  

We live in the most cerebral society of our human history, and yet ironically also the most irrational and illogical. We cause endless suffering for ourselves and endless damage to what surrounds us because we have lost the true foundations of understanding. In bastardizing math, we have forsaken good reasoning. In bastardizing play, we have forsaken true understanding.

To lose play is to lose access to our means of meaningful growth, as individuals and as a species.

A world that does not play with beauty cannot be truly beautiful.

A world that does not play with creation cannot be truly creative.

A world that does not play with reason cannot be truly rational.

*As such, to play is our human moral imperative.*
