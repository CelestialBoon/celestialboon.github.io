How does one stop feeling depressed? You describe it like something that’s under conscious control.

Also, depression reduces the capacity to act but increases the capacity to see clearly. Both are important if you want to be of some help.

Depression helps awareness like a hammer to the toe helps to raise awareness, in the sense that it *does* work, but you could do much better on the whole by some other means.

Having been both depressed and not depressed, I definitely do not recommend fetishizing the former.

A metaphor to put this in perspective is that of the garden - not only it has to be cleaned of the existing garbage for the good stuff to grow, but it has to be *kept free* of new garbage! And this requires aggressive policing!

Basically think of yourself as a garden - you find out that you've been piling up garbage in it from the outside, and the first step (they blend, but still) is removing the garbage (unlearning conditioning, healing trauma). That leaves the garden mostly empty, ideally.

The brain-mind is a very effective filter, which gives it the possibility of screening out the vast majority of trash information/energies that the world contains. You are not only free, but encouraged to keep the parts of the world that you don't like OUT

The mind is a filter of awareness, and this includes actually the task of withdrawing from the shit the system doesn't need to internalize.

In order to remain ignorant of bullshit, one must learn to skillfully withdraw curiosity. 

“Skillfully” is a contraction of “nonbuzzkillfully” which means “in a manner that’s not a buzzkill.”

For the parts that you can't help but interact with (which is a much smaller amount) that requires developing emotional self-mastery: being able to navigate that which you are actually involved in with poise, love, understanding, forgiveness, and compassion.

It is definitely possible to expand your circle of compassion and being able to embrace bigger topics, but that requires very deliberate practice, like lifting weights would! Tonglen is a prime example of this, but in general metta meditation is great for this purpose

Like, I can't stress enough that you have to KEEP THE SHIT THAT YOUR SYSTEM CAN'T HANDLE OUT OF YOUR MENTAL FEED, as much as possible! System hygiene 101! While possibly also working out your love to gradually embrace more of what life has to offer.

For me it's that feeling sorry for people deprives them of agency. It's treating them as if they weren't capable of dealing with the problem at hand. They are. You can empathise with their suffering without feeling sorry and be their cheerleader as they work through it. twitter.com/made_in_cosmos…

We can, but it's cool to consider that maybe you could usually keep it at a level that doesn't give you depression

Or alternatively, actually working your love so that instead of being pinned to the ground by the weight of the thing you keep on your back, you have the strength to lift it
