Now more than ever before, is a time where there an individual has potential access to world-shattering amounts of information, and from that information, knowledge may be abstracted. And from that knowledge, wisdom may be distilled.

It can feel exceedingly daunting to sift through such impossible amounts of **data**, but guiding you through this can be your own inner sense of truth. The one you can instinctively compare every notion that comes your way with, in order to assense its validity.

And even then, for all we gather from it, our models and beliefs are doomed to be partial, incomplete representations of what exists outside them, by the very nature of existence. All representations differ from the real thing. Every abstraction is leaky. The map shall never be the territory.

Not to mention *things shifting around us all the darn time*. We've always been at war with Eastasia, have we not? 

The certainty in our models can never be fully achieved, much like we could never fully encapsulate a river. No likeness of it will be *the actual flowing mass of water that is there*, and besides, the actual river is something impermanent and changing, so no still image or representation will be able of fully capturing that, for example.

But we can come close. And we can iterate on that closeness. And when the river shifts its course we can always chase it.  
Poetry may not fully capture the ineffable, but it can allude to it.  
Abstractions may not completely eliminate complexity, but they can streamline it.  
Systems may not account for the unfathomable, but we can expand them.

But as general advice, whatever happens, do not delude yourself that you've reached the end point. Everything is a work in progress, neverending in its iterations.

Remember how people thought that newtonian physics were surely the ultimate model of bodies interaction, now that they were finally discovered them *and they worked*, right?  
So how about that indivisible atom?  
Or [what about them dinosaurs](http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/newly-discovered-fossils-hint-all-dinosaurs-had-feathers/)?

But isn't that part of the beauty of it? Surely it would be *boring* if people eventually ran out of things to discover, and everything was just laid out.

There's always more out there to find out.

Keep your truth-seeking about you.
