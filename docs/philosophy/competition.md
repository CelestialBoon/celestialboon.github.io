There's this piece of info that I heard in a conversation and that I wish to share. Let's talk about the original meaning of the word "competition".

The etimology is Latin, from cum + petere, of which the latter is also the root of the word "petition".

"Petere" means to ask-to-obtain, or to move-towards, so cum + petere originally meant to "move/work together towards a single goal/objective." It is a meaning that is far closer to cooperation than what we mean today by competition.

Historically, throwing ourselves far enough back, it's possible to observe games such as races in which a banquet stood at the end but the group could eat only when the last racer crossed the finish line. No one gained anything but the fun of it by reaching it before then.

Or, it's observable in aboriginal/indigenous cultures how the youth plays games that are much more cooperative in nature eg. keeping a ball together into the air with sticks, as opposed to the more rivalry-oriented Western culture has.

This carries an implication that over time, the meaning of competition has degraded from this working/playing together into something where coming first brought a difference in status, gradually degenerating into outright rivalry (bringing the opponent down as path to victory)

The original meaning of competition is still alive in the word "competent," since competence is what naturally results in an environment in which everyone collaborates towards a common goal. *Competing* in such a manner makes people *competent*.

To get this in perspective, an environment that stays faithful to the original meaning of competition is the art *scene*, the place where ie. everyone exercises their art and plays to one-up one another for funsies, which results in a vibrant, knowledged and fun time.

Which also implies that "competent" originally carries a meaning less of personal skills, and more of the ability to work in and contribute to the context of a rich group environment.

Such things help me put in perspective that some things that we take entirely for granted in our culture might just be severe distortions from a nobler, and perhaps slightly forgotten, human nature.

And of course, bringing such meanings back into our culture can perhaps collectively show us a path to a more pleasant way to live.

I remember discovering the OpenTTD community, which uses "coopetition" for the original meaning of "competition"; I haven't played it for years (or much at all) but this is one thing that really stuck with me

Not to mention that the friendly one-upmanship of a scene can bring us severely amazing stories such as this one

For a modern example of original-competitive sports game, there's chinlone, the national sport of Myanmar (Burma), where there's only one squad and the goal is to keep the ball in the air for as long as possible.
