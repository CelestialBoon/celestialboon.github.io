Today I wanna talk about a topic very dear to me. I'll start with kintsugi.

It's that Japanese art that most of everyone has heard of before by now, the practice of taking broken pottery and putting it back together with laquer and precious paint (usually containing gold particles) in order to craft an object that takes on the quality of an item with <i>history</i>, and that displays its own personal path of vicissitudes with pride and grace.

As with many other Japanese practices, it is one that has tickled the nose of the spiritually-hungry Western man, and for good reason: there is a very interesting and valuable philosophy behind such a practice; a philosophy that runs counter to many of the modern Western values, and that many are craven to rediscover and apply in themselves.

The immediate first impression is that kintsugi is a smack in the face to consumerism: the anonimity of the brand-new product is foregone in favor of the accumulation of a very personal story that the item possesses; together with the repaired item, the individual who takes care of it also develops their own history, together with fonder, more heartfelt bonds with their possessions. 

Another obvious target is perfectionism. Breaking something not only isn't the end of the world, but it is in fact *an opportunity to develop something for the better*. It is a stark re-evaluation of mistakes, in the light that when handled well, they can lead down more interesting and more meaningful roads than what a plain spot-free life can offer.

Kintsugi represent the art of seeing the care that we have for something, and knowing that this care can be used to transform even unfortunate situations into something positive, meaningful, and beautiful.

For many, there is something that gets in the way of seeing things like this; a broader ideology that encompasses perfectionism and that sustains it, a mode of thinking that is so concerned with the past as to overshadow the present and future. Kintsugi looks at a broken dish and sees a potential for something great, while for many it close to impossible to see a broken something as anything but a permanent stain, both on the object and probably on the culprit as well. A once-broken dish for them would <i>remain broken</i>, as its fundamental quality, even when the pieces are put back together, while kintsugi can turn it from something broken into something <i>scarred</i>. And there's a huge difference there.  

A scar is a piece of lived history that a person wears directly on their skin, and we understand intuitively their appeal (like in the saying that "chicks dig scars") since they correlate with the experiences that person had, and a person with many experiences is more interesting and has more stories to tell, and is usually more mature.

For example, the best vantage point to help people navigate an experience is if you know what it's like, beccause you've been through it personally, so if you have been paying attention, you know what it feels like, what the pitfalls are, and what guidance is needed to come out the other side, hopefully guidance that is gently enough to not get in the way of their innate push for broad exploration.

Determinism is also an important offshoot of such past-focused thinking; it is essentially the concept that the past entirely determines the present, and this thinking weighs dearly on Western culture, remaining practically unchallenged on the down-low, despite being put heavily into question by quantum mechanics.

It is from such a framework that we usually look down on people's mistakes, since they stain a person's record permanently, engraved in constructs such as a school record first; and a curriculum vitae, or a criminal record, later. The past of a person (or of any group of people) is fundamentally irredeemable, for the past does not change; the records do not get wiped off. And the past is given so much weight that the consequences of such mistakes balloon in size on the social scale, enough to scare off most people from the prospect of ever trying much of anything.

This also easily leads to various vicious cycles; when people fall down (eg. into poverty, or into bad grades, or into criminal behaviours), they usually receive only half-hearted support because of the widespread belief that people cannot raise above their past; and because of this, we lack the structures and the know-how on how to truly help these people change; from this, such people are prone to remain downtrodden, and this further feeds into the belief that it is a chronic condition.  
Most obvious on this front is the treatment of criminals; not only they are thrown in prisons where they will be surrounded by other criminals, further exacerbating their alienation from society and their resentment; but when they are released, they find themselves in a society that rejects them on an economic level and on a community level, thus further pushing them towards the "life of crime." The saying goes that "once a criminal, always a criminal," and the societal structures do everything in their power to hold this true, ostracizing the person branded with personal failure at every turn.

It appears to some that some personal redemption from the prison of the past can be found in religions such as Christianity, with the concept of atonement for one's own sins, but this is a very weak departure, for it is clearly still founded on the concept that mistakes are entirely of negative quality and of no redeeming value, and that they only weigh down the person. This is in no way in opposition to the more secular creed, for sins also serve entirely to be held over a person's head in the context of judgment (just slightly transposed to a divine entity).

So what's the alternative to the condenment of error? I already mentioned elsewhere that [Gnostics proposed the theory of error](media/2021-06-27-friendship-letters.md), which codified the innate freedom of a human being to explore and try out things their own way, and their natural propensity to learn from their experiences, especially their mistakes. It is a diametrically opposite view to the modern Western one, since here mistakes are essential to the growing process. Without errors, human growth is greatly stymied; mistakes provoke in us the need for correction, and correction is a fundamental source of meaningful learning. Without being challenged, a system has little incentive to develop.

It is easy enough to observe that correction is our natural, instinctual feel-response to perception of mistakes; it is perfectly encapsulated in Cunningham's Law: "The best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer."  
Similarly, there is no moment more filled with the crystalline intention to do better than when laying on the dojo mat, literal or metaphorical, thrown to the ground by the opponent.

Mistakes are part and parcel of the act of doing, and of the learning process. In the Gnostic theory of error, it is not mistakes that damn humanity, but rather the <i>inattention</i> that allows mistakes to pass by unremarked and uncorrected, and thus spiral out of control. Inattention distorts and perverts the system of human growth, stripping it of the capacity for self-correction, leading down to the depths of what we call evil.

The notion of attentiveness being crucial is reflected, however poorly, in the practice of asking for forgiveness; is a social show of realization of personal mistakes, which is the precondition for correcting them. However, this practice has grown perverted over time as well, for it has mostly turned into a gesture of social appeasement, in which the social performance has become more important than the actual self-correction.

It is not all bad around here, naturally; there is a distributed presence of the wisdom that knows the utility of using our wanderings and exploration for the purpose growth, first of all the concept of "learning from our mistakes."

We can spot a similar reevaluation of error in the "fail fast" iterative procedure: by not shunning mistakes, but rather embracing them and acknowledging their essential presence in the creative process, a person/team is able to not only accomodate, but exploit the mistakes that are made on the way, in order to produce a better outcome. Aggressively prototyping, as early in the pipeline as possible, allows for flaws in design and understanding to surface early, where they're much simpler and cheaper to correct. 

In general, a creative process that manages to harness the inevitable presence of mistakes in order to fuel itself, that gives people true permission to fail, is a much healthier choice than something that opts for comfort and for What Works, for waving all the nasty stuff away and trying to not look at it too hard. 

More than that, a practice that embraces mistakes, experimentation, and just the generalized wandering of human experience is a framework that gives value to and exalts awareness, for awareness is the pivot of correction. Celebrating experimentation is also giving the due value and recognition to our capacity to make good use of it, to our capacity to be aware and present to life, and able to catch all the subtle hues and flavors and teachings of life, and treasure them inside ourselves, so that we become more, become bigger.

It is a widespread notion that leaving the comfort zone and challenging oneself is often necessary in order to grow, but the unsaid (and often glanced-over) implication is that in a zone of challenge and discomfort, there will be many new experiences, and also it will be very easy to make more mistakes than usual. And yet this is precisely the catalyst for growth, since the new experiences, and the challenges they offer to our ideas and to our abilities, are the starting point of the developmental process of correction. The mistakes one would do on the way are exactly part of the reason to venture outside the comfort zones.

Fear is a very natural response when venturing out our comfort zones, but [fear can be understood as perceiving the dissonance between our ingrained being/habits/perception and what is facing us](philosophy/2021-02-07-on-fear.md); in that key, it can be responded to by understanding what is outside of us, and changing what is inside of us accordingly. In that sense, fear is a catalyst to growth as well.

On a similar note, the disparate concepts of the hero's journey, the dark night of the soul, the shamanic process of death and rebirth, the alchemical process of distillation from negredo into albedo into rubedo, are all representative of our main pathway to growth; the venturing outside the known and into darkness and into lost-ness and into challenge and into error, in order for us to truly find ourselves there, to find the strength inside us that was waiting for the occasion to be useful; to find our resourcefulness, our resilience, our capacity to adapt and develop and grow, our true talents manifesting in the time of need. Breaking ourselves down in order to rebuild ourselves anew.

At the baseline, is through stimulation that we are able to experience the world, and each received stimuli necessarily changes us, for we are different by having received it and being aware of it; and the stronger and harsher the stimulation, the harder it is to integrate into our personal harmony, because it requires both greater effort and greater change, and its effects are more permanent.

This is a lesson that is etched in the very matter of our bodies; the foundations of life and experience are sensory perception, the interaction of the world outside with the body. And the stronger the stimulation, the greater the stress it puts the body through, and the greater the response required from the body system.  
- Guitar training strains the fingers, and the body has to adjust and develop calluses in order to grow comfortable again with the repeated stress.  
- In order to build muscle, the muscles have to be pushed past their literal breaking point; this is where the term <i>ripped</i> comes from, since one has to rip their muscles, filling them with microfractures, so that they are called to regrow, and regrow stronger in order to accomodate the new demands. The first training sessions are painful the days after for this reason: the person has to literally injure themselves in order for increase to happen at the muscular level.  
- Wounds are a greater stress still, which require prolonged efforts from the body in order to seal the wound and regrow matching living tissue.  
- A deep physical wound will develop a scar as the body's response to the rough treatment: scar tissue is tougher than skin, allowing the spot to bear the brunt of further heavy strain. Likewise, a broken bone regrows into a tougher mend, as a preventative measure of the body towards further stress.  

A common trait that all these metaphorical and literal scarring processes share is that the scar itself is higher-maintenance than the unblemished "skin": a phyiscal scar is a continuous process of sealing over the wound, and the wound will reponen when the process is interrupted eg. in cases of denutrition. Tougher, bigger muscles consume more energy than smaller, leaner ones. And yet, if a life's mere being has worth, it is also worth for this life to be fed the necessary sustenance in order for it to live <i>well</i>, and to be able to face adversities with the required strength. 

A proper stressing of the system is not only useful, but essential to ourselves in order to develop properly at all. [Much like plants who grow weak and frail when they do not bear the winds growing up](http://awesci.com/the-role-of-wind-in-a-trees-life/), we also miss out on the development of very crucial qualities when we pull away from life's challenges, or are denied them. Without met challenges, without facing one's own mistakes, a person does not develop resilience, and becomes unduly sensitive to rejection and to messing up, and grows ever so intimidated by what lies outside the comfort zone. They do not develop the confidence, born of experience, of knowing they are able to face adversity and come out the other side. Without varied life experience, a person does not have the conditions to mature.  
We're all wary of the spoiled brat, the person that's had it too easy in life, and as such has not had the occasion, or at least the werewithal, to develop all the human qualities that we so appreciate and respect. 

This applies especially for our emotional life; when we are young, we are very open and impressionable, and prone to receive [deep emotional wounds](https://www.ted.com/talks/la_carologie_les_5_blessures_de_l_enfance/transcript) that mark us for life. And since the ones that strike deeply enough cannot be removed or forgotten, the way to move past them is to scar them over, to develop the qualities that allow us to face our own reality and to understand it; to love ourselves despite all the people that haven't and don't; to enjoy life even though people have been—and will get—in the way; to develop trust in our capacity to move forward, and the wisdom that allows us to navigate a world rife with challenges and trials.

Just like harsh—but coherent—physical training makes people stronger, so a harsh emotional life, when treated properly and carefully, with the required amount of force, with the required amount of gentleness, and with the required grace, allows people to become empathetic, confident, kind, wise, and in general, emotionally intelligent and resilient.  

All of that said, there are certainly limits to how much stress we are able to positively handle. Eustress (literally "good stress") is usually the kind of stress/stimulation that comes often and in small doses. John Danaher, a Brasilian Jiu Jitsu master, wisely claims that [the vast majority of training should be against people of lower skill level](https://youtu.be/d07v5fJXXgM?t=520), because that is precisely the best occasion to experiment without being overly concerned with winning; in a competitive context, it is the best possible scenario where a trainee is free to try out stuff and just see what happens. Experience comes from experimentation, and experimentation is easier to come by when we are not as pressured to just succeed.  
The play environment is just as productive, for play is an excellent context to contain curious exploration and trying out new things, which are inherently fun activities. Turning life into play welcomes in countless opportunities for novelty, and thus growth, and maturation.

Sometimes it's easy and light, and sometimes it's harsh and haunting, but the process of learing and growing from our experiences is our truest life business, and the intricacies of it cannot be contained in any book. The process of learning is necessarily also a process of learning to learn, and experience is our only true teacher.

We are beautiful creatures, and we are all the more beautiful for our capacity to quietly thrive in adversity. To know ourselves as resilient, capable, antifragile creatures fills me with a kind of tenderness, the same way I would feel when I look at a tree that has been repeatedly twisted and bent by winds and collisions and having to chase the light, and nonetheless it succeeds, with a quiet pride and a coriaceous grace, to live, and to live well.
