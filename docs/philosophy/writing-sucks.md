Writing is an absolutely abysmal means of communication. It's no coincidence that it's very efficient information-wise (can be stored in relatively few bits)!

There is so much that we can communicate to one another that can't be squeezed nowhere easily into words.

Not only this means that writing depends heavily on common knowledge (and thus you can't reach very far with anything specific) but also that it's very difficult to displace people with writing (updating their beliefs), because of how little actual information it consists of!

People try to counter this with absolute tsunamis of words, and repetition, and all sorts of tricks, but it remains that it warps minds about what it means to carry meaning across. Even in verbal conversation 93 PERCENT of information is actually nonverbal!!!!!!

Like, I'm not sure people actually understand how huge that number is, and what it means wrt what communication actually is about, what it consists of, and what levels it touches and in what ways.
