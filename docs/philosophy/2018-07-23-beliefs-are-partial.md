I'll start with saying that *probability is a subjective estimate of events*.

Say B believes a certain coin has 50/50 chance of heads/tails. Then A flips that coin and hides the result. When he asks B if it's heads or tails *now*, B cannot reasonably know, and is forced to still hold that there's a 50/50 chance that it's either heads or tails, despite the result being fixed and being either 100% tails or 100% heads.

What is crucial is that B doesn't know WHICH is it, and *what he doesn't know cannot change his original estimate*. Probability is something that doesn't change with the coin's state, but rather with B's knowledge of such state.

Probability is something that lives in B's head, and is dependent on what B knows. *What is outside of B's head are the mere events*. Nowehere are the odds for something written in stone for us to see; *things just happen* and, as observers, we make our own estimate of their behaviour based on what we see and understand of it.

As a second point, *beliefs are personal estimates about reality*, about things that may or may not be true, may or may not have happened, or may or may not happen in the future (because who knows for sure, right?).

To the degree that these beliefs offer a falsifiable statement about reality, they can roughly be **measured** by assigning them a (again, subjective) probability. If someone believes something, it's (most often) possible to just ask them to put their money where their mouth is and come up with odds for that belief; odds that they would be comfortable betting on either side of, on both the giving and the receiving end.

For example, most people would assign 1:1 odds to a coin flip; if eg. A gave 1:2 odds for tails/heads on a balanced coin, then B could repeatedly bet on tails for a x3 payoff on 50% chance and break better-than-even on average each time, draining A of his money and misconceptions.

Nonetheless, the 1:2 odds is a probability assignment that A COULD have reasonably held if he believed that, for example, the coin was rigged, even if it wasn't. His odds reflect the view he has of reality, more than any extrinsic objective THING out there; and necessarily so, because who else are you going to ask for an odds estimate but an entity with LIMITED experience of the world?

Besides, a "balanced coin" is purely a concept, a thought-form. Realistically, no coin we have encountered is perfectly balanced, nor is it possible to realistically know if one exists, because odds aren't displayed in neon lights somewhere, and you would need infinite trials to "actually know".

Take an example: you have a (possibly rigged) coin that you have to determine the heads/tails odds of. You might flip it a bunch of times and record the results, and then past a certain number of flips, the odds could be realistically approximated as (number of heads) : (number of tails), but those are just our **projected** odds. It is also true that ANY coin with ANY odds that are not absolute (like say, a coin that will always produce tails) can theoretically produce that exact string of results, if with increasingly vanishing probability the more we distance ourselves from the coin's projected odds.

There's simply no way to know for sure; we just reach a point where we're confident enough about our answer that we just go "eh, fuck it" and call it a day.

This is how it goes for pretty much everything; we are subjected to events that influence our beliefs (our estimates about the world) and we update those beliefs accordingly. The rationally-sanctioned method to update beliefs is called *Bayesian updating*, where we just update our (probabilistic) odds by [multiplying it by the (again, projected) Bayes factor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4VkPoG3ko) of a certain event-result.

In such a context, there is nowhere space for true, unshakeable certainty. For that which has reached absolute certainty is effectively dead; no multiplication can ever displace 0:1 odds. No event or perception can influence it anymore. It is no longer part of the flow of life, and instead exists outside of it.

What we do manage on the regular, instead, as beings with a limited view of the world, is tentative beliefs that are not meant to be final, and in fact get updated all the time. We have beliefs that are realistically **falsifiable**, since they are not certain. Some beliefs are sturdier than others, but none are *certain*, for absolute certainty is one true sign of insanity. What would you say to someone that firmly believes something despite any and all evidence to the contrary? That would never ever accept the possibility that their beliefs are wrong? That would keep on believing something no matter how often or how overwhelmingly it is proven wrong?

The rest of us deal with things that could be either true or false, for all we know, and in so doing, we navigate life by holding multiple possibilities in our heads: this project could go well or it could go badly; someone might accept or reject my invitation to hang out; the sun might rise tomorrow but there's the smallest theoretical possibility that it might just not, for whatever reason. <!-- We *do* believe that the sun as we know it will just stop existing at some point in time, and there's just the vanishing possibility that it might be tomorrow. -->

In the same way the coin A just flipped is either definitely heads or it's definitely tails, and B knows it has to be one of these twoâ€”even without knowing which! Believing a thing is both true and false at the same time is just human nature. We do not, and cannot have, perfectly accurate beliefs from a limited perspective. We juggle opposing possibilities on the regular, and adjust the course on the go by weighing them against ongoing experience.

We live in a shifting world of incomplete and sometimes misguiding information, a world of shadows and echoes, and our inner model of the world reflects this, no matter how much we like to pretend otherwise. *Our beliefs are partial*, in the sense that we do not actually believe anything with pure certainty, just (shifting) degrees of confidence.

This dynamicity of beliefs reflects not only our partial access to information, but also the simple truth that *things just change over time*. As the Buddhists preach, a very core component of reality is **anicca**, its inherent impermanence and transience. Not one single thing lasts forever, or is for certain.

Terms and conditions subject to change. 

This too shall pass.

And as thing change, changing our minds about them is the healthiest option we have to relate to them. Since we cannot have certainty or lasting stability, the next best thing is acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in living, and making the best out of it that we can.
