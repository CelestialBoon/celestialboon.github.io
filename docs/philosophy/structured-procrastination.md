procrastination on its own is a different affair (fear of doing things because self-image depends on success each time)
but structured proc is because you don't tie as much when you feel you're already failing

Structured procrastination (can do whatever as long as it's not the thing supposed to be done) works because the act of doing something else is fundamentally an act of rebellion to authority. It's part of growing up and developing your own executive independence.

It's part of the natural process of emotional growth, but it's stymied because the judgmental criticism is excessive and internalized, and it doesn't let the individual grow into someone who is truly guided by their own judgment, their own needs and their own desires.

Procrastinators are stuck halfway through the adolescent phase of developing their own voice that speaks for what they really want, but can't manage to outgrow authority because authority is everywhere, and it's internalized, and it's assumed the right thing to do.

Even discipline is therefore warped by circumstance into somehow forcing oneself into doing what we don't want to do, even if there's a much nobler definition of discipline, which is "remembering what you want." (- David Campbell)

Very paradoxically, the way out is actually by celebrating procrastination; by realizing that the impetus to procrastinate is the push to grow independent, and to goad it into revealing our inner desires, and to dance with it so to ultimately live by one's own inner compass.

It's scary, and it's embracing a part of ourselves that is unknown and that doesn't work like thoughts do, but to grow from adolescence into adulthood means building on top of all the new and wild parts of you, into a structure of true responsibility, which is to yourself first.
