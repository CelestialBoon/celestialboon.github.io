TODO PROBABLY NEEDS SOME MORE MEAT

I've been reminded today of how insidious our imprinting from our early environment can be.

I've been told recently that my dad wants to help me when I fail, but it goes deeper than that. It's something that he feels to be an inevitable duty, and it's also a solid fear of his.

So between his fear and belief, there's been a strong *expectation* on me, however subconscious, for me to fail and to need to ask for help. Ironically, I've felt it on some level and always resisted it in part, but I wasn't able to break out its grasp in any case.

What it took was becoming conscious of this pattern, and also a morning in the woods where I brought myself out of breath with exertion and I just opened the gates; I screamed the primal screams of those who call for help, where I wouldn't be helped.

I've brought to the surface this pattern, but at the same time, I did it in a condition where it wouldn't perpetuate the cycle it is predisposed towards. (Incidentally, I feel that more people could probably use a place for free emotional expression such as this.)

After this detoxification, I was able to look at myself as having lived with the weight of this expectation of me, that I partly resisted but never fully addressed on the right terms. I lived a small life because I didn't dare to become big enough not to need the help of my dad.

And so that's the first step to healing. To unlearn is a central theme of Zen, as several other philosophies, and for the excellent reason that it's only realistic to expect someone to follow their inner, gentle Nature if no greater, more violent distortions are at play.

We imprint on our early environment and make it our emotional comfort zone, to which the bodymind pushes to return when disturbed from such an equilibrium, even when moved towards the positive. This structure was built over years, and years is the likely estimate to undo it.

So much resistance to getting better that we face daily is really just our individual and collective push to maintain a distorted homeostasis, and what it takes to move forward is demolishing it, through truckloads of compassion, especially self-compassion.

Step by step, it is possible to undo all the conditioning that pushes us towards something that we don't want to be, not anymore. In doing this, the purest, most sincere and unconditional love is our best companion in the journey.
