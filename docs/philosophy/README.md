This is a section dedicated to personal philosophy, methods and recounts of introspection, and shadow work. It pertains to one's personal exploration of their universe, both inner and outer, to figure out how we work, why we work, what made us this way, and what we can do about it. It contains tools for understanding, exploration and empowerment.

A lot of this section deal with trauma and its conseguences in life, since it is an ubiquitus reality in our broken society, and it has to be addressed as such. Some preliminary reading on trauma is recommended in general, more so to follow along some posts here.

Many of these posts aim to deconstruct old beliefs, for our headspace is in some ways limited, and we something must be torn down for something else to rise.

Countless influences and inspirations are at play here, but dearest to my heart are those of Alan Watts and Terence McKenna, which I cannot recommend enough.
