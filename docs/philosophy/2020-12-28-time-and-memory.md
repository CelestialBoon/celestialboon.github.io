Today we continue our exploration into the possible Nature of Things by examining:

Time, and its relationship to memory.

So there's something else to talk about wrt the ego that didn't find space in the 100 tweets thread, and we might as well do so now:

The relationship between ego and memory. https://twitter.com/celestialboon/status/1208371376953942022

1. We start with the million dollar question: what the fuck IS time?

"What then is time? If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I do not know." - St. Augustine

2. That time is so elusive a concept should be our first clue that it's not a thing-in-itself; it's not something you can point at, like an apple. Which likely makes it a relationship of sorts.

3. A friendship is not something you can point to, that you can say exists *somewhere*; it's just something that exists in relationship to two beings.

Distance is the same thing; it's only defined between two points. Worse, it's effectively meaningless before THREE points exist.

4. Two distinct points can always be defined to have a distance of 1.
When you get 3 points, you start having the wild idea of having to measure how much two of those points might be *more distinct* than another 2. Thus, distance as (relative) measurement.

5. In much of the same way, time is a measurement, just like distance is a measurement, between two parts of experience (based on another two). Distance in seconds, distance in meters.

6. Two points are defined to have distance = 1 meter, and with that you measure the distance between 2 other points. One event is defined as 1 second long, and with that you measure two other points in time.

7. But underneath distance, there is space. Distance is a way of putting measure to space.

So what is underneath time? Time is very obviously a measure of *something*, but what is this *something* that time is measuring?

8. To answer that, we need to talk about Paralle- I mean, about the Eternal Present Moment.

9. The Eternal Present Moment is a concept that is most prominent in Eastern philosophies: everything that you perceive, is taking place Now. Everything that anyone has ever experienced was taking place, or will take place, in some Now.

10. What experience is made of, is this continuously ongoing, eternal present Now. The Present Moment is all that is, was and ever will be, precisely because that's where all the action takes place all the time, and nowhere else. If it happens, it happens Now.

11.The past, thus, cannot be said to truly Exist, and our memory of it, then, is the left imprint of different perceived states of the Now. Our imagination is our connection to other *potential* states of the Now, and both are what allow us to "escape" the Now in the first place.

12. (Ironically, both memory and imagination remain part of the Now; each recollection and each fantasizing take place Now. We just pretend that they're something that don't belong to the Now, in some weird twisty sense.)

13. Without memory, there would be no sense of something that happened that was different from Right Now; there would be no sense of change. Everything would be happening and we wouldn't be able to draw connections to a different state. The current State would be all that is.

14. Thus, our memory gives us a very poignant realization: that the Now doesn't stay the same all the time. We can recognize differences between some Now and some other Now (whatever *that* means), and as such we stumble upon the concept of Change.

15. Change is this property of the Now by which the experience of the Now is distinguishable from the imprint it left. It's like looking back to your tracks to realize you aren't just walking in place, but you have been in fact moving forward to some other point in space.

16. Just like sight allows us to hold two distinct objects in space at the same time in our vision, to recognize that there IS distance between them, so memory allows us to hold two imprints of Now side-to-side and realize that they are different; that time passed between them.

17. Space IS, and within space we find the means in order to measure distance. Change IS, and within change we find the means in order to measure time.

Distance is the distinct-ness of space; time is the distinct-ness of change.

18. To measure space, we find the most reliable, stable & convenient means, and we use those as measuring stick (eg. the Prototype Metre Bar).
We have done the same for time ie. taken what's most reliable, and what's most reliable is what is periodically reoccurring: vibrations.

19. We've taken vibrations of different scale such as the arcs of the sun in the sky, the cycle of the seasons, the oscillation of quartz crystals etc. and elevated those as measuring stick of change.

20. They themselves are a manifestation of change, just like a Metre Bar manifests in space. They're just somehow stable changes: always changing and yet staying the same in some sense, enough for us not to doubt that they've altered our measurements substantially.

21. The sense of time that is observed in, and measured by, the change/oscillations of events around us, is what could be termed the more "objective" perception of time. This includes our periodic bodily functions, which amount to a biological clock of sorts.

22. To note: the biological functions do not operate on a "stable clock", and are dependent on external cues to some degree; eg. a person's circadian rhythm can be shifted away from the usual 24 hours (there's at least an hour of give, possibly more https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1934931/
 )
Plasticity of the Intrinsic Period of the Human Circadian Timing System
Human expeditions to Mars will require adaptation to the 24.65-h Martian solar day-night cycle (sol), which is outside the range of entrainment of the human circadian pacemaker under lighting...

23. Given that memory gives us the most immediate impression of change, it's fairly natural that memory would also be involved in our perception of time itself; in fact we could go as far as calling memory our more "subjective" side of the sense/experience of time.

24. Consider waking up from a slumber; on awakening, we might have the impression no time has passed between falling asleep and waking up. At some point, a dream might be remembered, and suddenly that empty time gets filled up and feels to us that it actually happened after all.

25. Objective time gives us an intellectual notion that time has passed, but our visceral sense of lived time resides with the more subjective, felt perception, which is tied to memory.

26. Much like waking up from a "dreamless" sleep, amnesiacs have no visceral perception that the time of which they hold no memory has passed, and if their sense of self depends on those memories, at some level they may remain stuck in time.

27. And of course, since most of everyone's memory works in uneven ways, our sense of subjective time is also prone to dis-homogeneity eg. "Where has this evening gone?" or "This movie felt like it would never ever end."

28. We find our subjective sense of time in such sayings as "When you sit with a nice girl for two hours you think it's only a minute, but when you sit on a hot stove for a minute you think it's two hours," and similar experiences.

29. The more attentive reader will notice that emotional experiences are the biggest causes of time unevenness, and indeed, strong emotions/feelings are among the biggest influencing factors of memory formation.

6. A lot of "learning something" ends up deeply enmeshed with the circumstances of the learning: the place, the people, the actions, but ESPECIALLY the emotions—emotions are incredibly strong material to weave memories with.

30. If we're on a ship in a featureless sea, memory is like the trail that the ship is leaving; the bigger the trail, the stronger our perception that distance has been crossed.


31. A closing note: time is linear in the same way that space is linear, which means, somewhat locally, and extrapolated globally mostly by wishful thinking.

32. Both space and time can be observed to be LOCALLY linear, with some coarse approximation. We know that space is fundamentally curved, or at least curve-able, and no global guarantees about time can be made from local observation either.

33. For example, Relativity shows us how both time and space are distorted by such phenomenons as speed (Special Relativity) and gravity/acceleration (General Relativity).

As always, none of the ideas contained here are my original ideation; people such as Alan Watts and Eckhart Tolle have much to say about the nature of Time, specifically about that of the Now.
