So there's something else to talk about wrt the ego that didn't find space in the 100 tweets thread, and we might as well do so now:

The relationship between ego and memory.

1. Ego relies heavily on memory—the past events on which one's personal story is woven; the patterns in behaviour that are abstracted into a personality; the tracking of all things that were before, and continue to be, me and mine. But it goes deeper than that.

2. Even without explicitly recalling the past, even when not thinking, most of us have a strong feeling-sense of what is often called "identity", an ongoing continuity of ourselves, a feeling that it's really us here and that we're roughly the same as we were some time before.

3. This happens below explicit recall and is more perceived as an intuitive sense of continuity, familiarity, connection with our past selves. It is the perception of subconscious connections being drawn between the present and what we already experienced: our past.

4. In this sense, this is still memory at work, but in a different modality that we are used to consciously acknowledge (the explicit recall of specific events). Both relate to our experienced past, and it is also very noteworthy to explore the interaction between the two.

5. The memory feeling-sense is incredibly useful to form new memories, because, as always, we work best mentally by drawing connections, and the memory-sense provides a ready tapestry onto which new threads of experience can be gradually woven in, interwoven with the old.

6. A lot of "learning something" ends up deeply enmeshed with the circumstances of the learning: the place, the people, the actions, but ESPECIALLY the emotions—emotions are incredibly strong material to weave memories with.

7. This in part explains why it's easier to learn when subjected to new experiences (eg.traveling): routine has us mostly trace over old existing threads without adding much, while something new has us weave new tapestry, with all that gets caught within.

8. This memory-sense is going on in the background for most of us, continuously linking up the present to past experiences, and allowing the painless accumulation of memory and learning to happen by accretion.

9. It is interesting to observe when this memory-sense fails: what happens then? People lose familiarity with themselves and the world around us, don't recognize themselves or people around them anymore. They lose the innate sense of who they are or what others are, or of reality

10. Losing familiarity of themselves is depersonalization; losing familiarity of reality is derealization; losing familiarity of other people is Capgras syndrome ie. feeling that those you used to know aren't themselves anymore, and have been replaced by copies, aliens etc.

11. With depersonalization, no connection is drawn between what's happening now inside the bodymind and some past similar event; it is felt, but it also does not feel theirs. It doesn't feel familiar. It's not *them*. This also leaves very little for an ego to work with.

12. Without the felt sense that one's body and mind are theirs (because no continuity or familiarity is felt), an ego has no solid grounds to claim these parts of experience as self, and this often generates frustration at the perceived and unsatisfied need to form an identity.

13. From this chain of reasoning, it is likely that the path out of depersonalization/derealization/Capgras syndrome involves for many a reconnection with memory and a recovery/retraining of the memory-sense.

14. Among the possible reasons why this link might not be there, trauma and neglect are likely candidates—in the same way dissociation prevents new traumatic inputs to reach felt experience, so the loss of memory-sense might be a defensive measure to avoid accumulation of trauma.
