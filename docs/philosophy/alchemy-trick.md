I think I figured out the trick to alchemy.

To clarify, I'm definitely not the first to have done it; as always, I'm standing on the shoulders of giants. Many pieces have been left around for me to figure it out, even if it's taken me a while to put them together.

Like for example how all sensation is neutral, and how it's recognized in the BDSM scene that pain is merely "strong sensation."

Or how suffering is merely born from resistance to What Is.

Or,

It turns out that not just sensation, but in general emotion is also neutral. Which leaves us the choice of how to take events, with possibly surprising results, just like people can reach ecstasy from the pain of being whipped by their partner.

It's been said that anger is a clarity that's gone out of focus, or how anxiety is really some other emotion that is being suppressed and wants to come out.

It seems to me that more in general, every negative emotion is the flip side of a positive one.

Specifically, fear is a mask of ecstasy.

Like, you know how people can be excited at having something and then immediately fear for losing it? That's exactly the thing. That fear is the same energy, but tone-shifted into fear instead of joy.

The fear of death (as transformation) is the same energy as the love of life (as ongoing transformation).

Envy can be a tone-shift of inspiration, or of joy for seeing someone's gift realized and shared.

Anger is a tone-shift of the clarity that brings impulse to action.

Resentment can become appreciation for someone who taught us a valuable, strong lesson in life, by whatever means they used.

Judging someone for a lack can transform into the joy of the opening of the opportunity to share yourself, to teach, to show, to reveal.

And the trick is that this shift can be made consciously, in each moment.

Like how people skydive to turn their *fear* of falling into the *elation* of falling.

Or how people can choose to defuse a situation by laughing it up.

Or any of the uncountable, wordless ways we can transmute our inner states towards understanding, towards forgiveness, towards compassion, towards appreciation, and so on.

Each moment energies stream into us, events happen, experiences are made, we feel things, and each moment we are presented with the choice of how to take what happens. It is the choice between fear and love.

This is what free will is about. It is exactly the freedom to experience the energies that come to us either in the ways of fear, or in the ways of love. A choice made each and every moment.

This is what is really meant with the "choice between good and evil."

For example, our very inbreath is the invisible coming to fill the visible, out of pure lust for life. But then this desire can manifest as fear/hate for life, or as love for life. Desire is the motor, but its thrust is in our hands to direct one of two ways.

It is said that (shamanic) ecstasy is the riding between boundless joy and sheer terror, but that's because, borne out of an ongoing confrontation with the Unknown, such a choice has to be renewed every single moment. It's the riding of the crest of great emotional energy.

Alchemy is the practice of transmutation of energies, and being able to shift the energies of your local universe into love is what emotional self-mastery is about.

This is the principle behind tonglen. Of how all the suffering in the world can be turned into the purest love, simply by breathing it in and letting the heart do the magic. This is the immense power of our hearts.
Tonglen.

And, shadow work is the reclaiming of the personal channels of energy that have been shifted into fear and suppressed because of it. It is the reappropriation of one's personal power by means of loving what has been feared.

Our greatest fears come from the channels of our greatest power, our strongest desires; and all those channels can be re-opened and healed (transmuted) to provide renewed influx of life, of energy, of love, of creativity, of plenty, that are all rightfully ours.

It is a path to mastery, and it is naturally one that requires practice, contemplation, openness, and plenty of understanding and compassion. I've experienced it personally; it is very possible to walk it successfully.

There is nothing that needs to be feared.
