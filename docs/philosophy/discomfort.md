We as culture have a troubled relationship with discomfort, and for good reason: we keep forcing discomforting situations on people, which don't get better past the initial hurdle (see: school, work). We impose discomfort on everyone as way of life, & we rightly don't like it.

People end up running away from discomfort because it doesn't just go away if accepted in many ordinary cases, and that is severely damaging to one's ability to grow and improve.

Discomfort is a close companion of growth, but that's only if we come out the other side.

Discomfort is something we don't like, and it usually works out because it pushes us to come to a place of rest beyond it, where we've overcome it by stretching our boundaries. But people are not built to withstand endless discomfort; we seek comfort because we need our R&R.

Discomfort is great in small doses, but it should be approached with the notion that it cannot be endlessly sustained, and that it is best accepted in the interests of your own path and progress, not just to serve someone else's (which don't even know you and your limits!)
