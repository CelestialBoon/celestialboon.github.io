There are many reasons we might delay doing something: sometimes we don't have the energy for it, or it's just not the right time for something. But when we find ourselves avoiding tasks on in a manner that deep down feels basically unjustifiable, that's procrastination.

Procrastination is something that most of everyone will have some experience with; for such an apparently nonsensical behaviour, it is surprisingly widespread, and something that gives many people no amount of frustration, and often leads them to poorer grades or results than what they otherwise would or could achieve.

So what is going on?

Let's start with self-image.

As social animals, we are equipped to work with, and care for, our social environment. This includes an assessment of our social position and reputation within communities; a knowing of what others see us as, what their expectations for us are, and how we should manuever in such an environment to either maintain or improve our (social) status.

This leads to the first immediate counter-sense, that one's personal self-image is *actually a social phenomenon*. People existing outside of a society, [such as hermits](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/mar/15/stranger-in-the-woods-christopher-knight-hermit-maine), have no need for any elaborate self-image, including the widespread ego-process: just the intuitive knowledge of one's skills is more than enough for a solitary context.

The need for a self-image is only born through the requirements and the vicissitudes that living in a society places on us, and self-image is necessarily socially mediated, *but also* internalized as a personal framework early on, in order to handle it with a tighter feedback loop.

The mechanisms related to self-image are very innate to us, and thus, mostly subconscious; they operate at a level of autonomy eg. probably just a few steps above digestion. It is something that influences our life deeply, and that we can influence in turn (if through indirect means).

And since one's social image is such an important and influential "part" of ourselves, it is something that will be strenuously defended and fought for, even at the detriment of other aspects/achievements of life. Among many, procrastination is one method to achieve this.

Let's make an example to better connect the dots: between two students, which one is going to sound the smartest and coolest?

a) the student who got through a big project by doing a chunk of it each day;

b) the student who did the big project in the last hours before the deadline like it was something that they barely cared about and they still suceeded?

Is the picture getting clearer?

Procrastination is a sub-process (one could even say a failure mode) of self-image management.

When we have a certain image to maintain (and thus to *maintain performatively*), then we are pressured to act out behaviours that sustain that self-image. For example, doing homework on time and taking as many hours as it needs is for the diligent, <i>average</i>, <i>boring</i> students, while doing the assignment under much tighter constraints (such as the precious few hours before the deadline) is something only someone <i>smart</i> and very <i>capable</i> could manage. Thus, we use the occasion to reaffirm the image of someone capable and intelligent by placing ourselves in tight, limiting and suboptimal conditions, digging ourselves a hole that we can later claw our way out of.

Notice how this unhealthy mechanism is born out of the seemingly-harmless but actually quite deleterious goals/expectations we put on people, especially early on in life (where they're most influential/damaging). For example, how parents expect (or at least wish for) their kids to be not just smart, but *smarter than average*, to be *better than peers*, so that they can win contests and prevail in life within a hyper-competitive society. Such a pressure to be (and thus, project/perform the image of) someone-better-than-others pushes people to put themselves in situations where they are constrained in tighter bindings than what is asked of them; or rather, than what is expected of the *average student/worker/person*.

You can notice that this can lead to nasty feedback spirals. If many people all want to be better than others, they will squeeze themselves dry to outperform one another, and in the case in which some do get selected for higher-level programs, the pressure to overperform remains, and so no matter how tough or ludicrous the requirements of programs are, some people will still push themselves to even stricter limits purely for the need to self-identify as someone who outperforms their environment. This is inoculated in school systems but it will effortlessly transition into adult environments such as work and social life.

This is an image that many overworkers maintain in life (being people who work hard and maybe work even harder outside of work, with deluges of side projects and achievements), and that society actively encourages (always looking for the most selfless, the most self-sacrificing and hardest worker, the highest achiever, the next Alexey Stakhanov).

That said, there's limits to human nature, so what happens when those expectations exceed said limits? Tragically, a collapse of the pretense of self-image is very rare in our society; what instead happens is defense mechanisms: rationalizations that make up excuses for ourselves as for why we couldn't do the project in time, even though we're so smart and capable and we could have <i>totally</i> done it, even in the last day, even with all that anxiety and pressure breathing down our necks.

Even if we didn't make it, somehow we still could have possibly done it that way, and *thinking we could* is the part that really matters. Thinking that *we could* is entirely the goal of the mechanism of preservation of self-image, and what keeps the charade going.

I'll repeat here. If people admitted that no, they put too much strain and too many expectations on themselves and they *couldn't* have reasonably done it, then that would be the first step to the collapse of existing self-image (and if directed correctly, actual change and growth).

In our society, which lacks the frameworks and the structures and the overall culture to really support a shift of this import, this is a terrifying prospect, and is thus avoided at all costs.

The alternative, thus, is to keep living the lie, making us feel good all the while believing that we <i>are</i> that capable, if only we didn't do Bullshit Decision #5 or #46 or if Bad Thing #93 didn't happen to us that time.

Some things are procrastinated indefinitely because facing them would face us with our inexperience, with our inadequacy, or whatever event that would destabilize our social standing, or at least upset our self-image; all of which would be a direct blow to our fragile ego, which in self-defense postpones the act indefinitely while still affirming that yes, <i>obviously</i> that's a thing we can do, we just won't right now because XYZ.

In a world where personal change is disincentivized, many people's best option is to continue sticking to the original plan despite all else; to hold to their mask come hell or high water.

Some examples of this dis-incentivization are a culture that doesn't encourage experimentation and rarely forgives, operating on multiple levels on the "Once Bad, Always Bad" principle (see: permanent grade history, criminal records, cancel culture, etc.). While such a system is <i>not</i> unjustified in the current environment, it is a sick piece of a sick society puzzle; only with a radically (at-the-roots) different society would a different methodology be the most reasonable at large.

This, of course, leads to a very toxic environment where people are at no point incentivized to *be themselves*: that is, people with their own peculiarities and differences (instead of being stamped out into conformity and compliance through "education"), their own life paths (insted of the pre-arranged school and carreer paths), their own freedom to make mistakes (instead of a culture that will hold their mistakes against them forever), and their ability to bring something unique to the world (where instead only the most basic of instruction-following is required of the vast majority of people for the majority of their time).

Instead, people are asked to be *anything but themselves*; they're asked to obey, to follow rules, to behave, to keep in line with everyone else, to follow someone else's instructions and fulfill the goals of someone else.

All this surrounded by heavy punishments should one not conform, which leads to rigid internalization of such a system.

This manifests as a self-facing mechanism as procrastination, but also for some it will manifest as an *outward-facing* mechanism ie. *serial liars*: people that cannot and will not, for any reason, admit to their mistakes and shortcomings, and instead will do everything possible to hold on to their social image and convince others of its veridicity, including destroying the social standing of those who would denounce it. This includes narcissists, which hold to their self-image by way of tooth and claw.

As a (what is by now a) small aside, structured procrastination— which is the practice of doing a second thing in the time you were supposed to do a first thing—is something that *does work* for many, but is also a perverse mechanism which relies on several factors such as:

- Our push to dis-obedience and disrespecting external (now-internalized) authority in order to acquire emotional growth;

- Our ability to remain disappointed in ourselves even when we get something done this way (so not to upset our self-image);

- A non-trivial amount of doublethink.

Like most of what gets built on top of Western society, it is a perverse adaptation to a perverse situation; it <i>works</i>, but there are much better alternatives given the option of a much more inclusive path of healing.

It sounds obvious enough, but the true nature of Man is *to be themselves*, without needing anyone who coerces or directs them, but rather possessing the willingness and the intelligence to participate to the collective in the best way possible, which is exactly the way that they want deep down, and which is the most satisfying for everyone involved.

There are people who end up "finding their talents" and live a life doing their best work, and liking what they do, and contributing positively to society through doing a thing that they love doing, and that they love sharing with other people. 

Invariably, this isn't something that someone else ordered them to do, but something that they just had deep down inside and that they learned to bring out of themselves and manifest into physicality.

And as much as society as it exists now won't encourage self-realized people, *true healing always begins with the individual*. There <i>are</i> people who have escaped the disastrous commitment to a false, static self-image, and it is possible to "find the others," as Terence McKenna put it, so to create support structures, friendships and communities.

There is no true satisfaction to be found anywhere trying to be someone we're not. The choice to walk the path of healing is the choice between a life of challenges, and a life of challenges and regret.
