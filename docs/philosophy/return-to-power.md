As kids, so many of us are taught that our full expression is unacceptable; that we are too much; that people don't like and don't want our light. And so we dim it, to conform and fit in. We are that desperate to belong.

We restrict our range of expression. We repress strong feeling. We learn to breathe shallowly so not to stir energy. We anesthetize parts of ourselves, losing feeling and consciousness in them, by cutting power to them.

In turn, those parts become our shadow, which like underpowered electronic components, are darker, prone to malfunction, and don't integrate well with the architecture. They have nasty behaviours and confound us; shouldn't they play nice with the system? They were supposed to!

A return to health is a return to power, and to light; to *let* ourselves be powerful again, to draw in the full breath each time (filling from genitals to top of the head!) since our system needs light to see and power to keep the lights on.

The whole of ourselves needs that power to function well.
The reclaiming of the shadow can only happen through bringing the light (energy, consciousness, love) back. The process of reintegration, at the core, is about getting these parts back into operation. Full systems online.

There are so many people who feel frustrated because they have so much love to give, but what's important to realize is that so much of this love is supposed to go to themselves, to the *fullness* of themselves, to power themselves up. Then, they can illuminate the landscape.
