I think that working it from the physical equivalent makes sense. Physical stress happens when the body undergoes upsets without chance of recover. Emotional stress could be just the same: emotions repressed and never processed because the event has to repeat.

The rats faced with the choice of crossing the fence have to swallow their fear each time because otherwise they wouldn't cross. And they can't process it because nothing would change next time. Helpless rats can release it because they don't have to put themselves through

If you don't have to push the button to resist the shock, you can grieve the damage. But if you have to push the button you have to keep the fear inside so that you go push it, grieving would put you back at square one.

Forcing beings to fearful choices again and again puts them in a position where they can't move on emotionally; the stuff remains inside, and the turmoil damages them from within.

This is true.

This explanation, though points towards internalization and adaptation. To an extent "regular" pain becomes "regular" and may even increase the pain threshold. Regular adjustments are part of living, but "irregular" adjustments...

Very ironically, chronic pain actually lowers the pain threshold. It's sporadic pain that increases it.

Adaptation to a constant risk is, appropriately, becoming more sensitive to said risk, which makes sense from a pure survival standpoint, but kinda wrecks living.
