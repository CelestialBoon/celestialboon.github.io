I keep thinking about this post. It's so good. It's so fucking good. It's a hilariously powerful model. I keep drawing new connections to it.

Like how a lot of the usual things we use to distract ourselves or beat ourselves up about are energy sinks, to manage internal energy by diverting it somewhere else.

Or how the theory of neural annealing ties incredibly well with shamanism and shamanic practices.

Shamans are the masters of ecstasy, which is a very desirable high-energy state, and high-energy states are what bring annealing (which amounts to brain reconfiguring, which can be highly valuable and profoundly healing in the right modalities).

Shamans avail themselves of psychedelics, premium tools for bringing easy, desirable high-energy states. In such states, new configurations can be easily achieved, new solutions found; they are the moment of maximum plasticity, and with the right amount of focus, miracles happen

Music, which also contributes to high-energy states, is in their department. Especially drumming, which is traditionally sounded at the frequencies of system-wide resonant waves, promoting reconnection of the bodymind.

The rites of passage to become shaman are typically death-and-rebirth events, which imply massive annealing and a reshaping of the initiate's psyche into whatever the master shaman will guide them into. It frees them from the old issues (including trauma) and molds them anew.

This includes the usage of ordeal poisons, which cause overwhelming sensations, which are very convenient means to cause high-energy states, again, with consequent annealing. With proper set+setting, even big pain/suffering can be used for radical positive transformation.

The shaman is a master healer in part because they have mastered the techniques that bring high-energy, and thus annealing, and thus healing. They are incredibly resilient, supremely antifragile, and the most apt to navigate the seas of the Beyond and recover from any mishap.

To revive shamanism is also to bring back the science of ecstasy into culture, which is a supremely important tool for healing, for growing, for problem-solving, for molding communities, shaping societies, and ultimately, giving us a chance.

Also I'm madly in love with neural annealing also because it's completely in line with one of my favourite quotes of all time:
