This is an intuition of something that is deeply true about ourselves: we are so profoundly in tune with Nature that the mere sight of it resonates through us to positive effect.

It's been shown in studies that hospital patients will greatly benefit (reduced recovery time and less need for painkillers) from having gardens to frequent or even just plants to look at in their room!

There's a inviting friendliness to Nature that pleases the eye and relaxes tension at the mere sight. I find my eyesight sharpening when drinking in the shapes and colors of my garden.

Nature is something we're deeply, deeply connected to, in ways that sometimes only make sense when talking about parts of ourselves. Being cut off from nature can feel like being cut off from some body function.

It gets to the point that nature therapy is a thing! Also called shinrin-yoku in Japanese, just spending time in Nature can do wonders for people's immune systems, mental health, mood, healing factors, and a host of other factors.

For reading material on the subject, personally I recommend The Biophilia Effect: A Scientific and Spiritual Exploration of the Healing Bond Between Humans and Nature, by Arvay, Graham and Bekoff

Terence McKenna, on his first trips on mushrooms, straight from the Amazon, had the psychedelic realization that the mushrooms were "human flesh".

More in general, Western culture greatly underestimates just how much Nature is a fundamental part of our human selves.

Early astronauts became surprisingly weak and ill on their space journeys before the discovery that the vibrations of the Earth's electromagnetic field (named Schumann resonance) were fundamental to human health; it was later replicated artificially in space ships.

The concept that one's being ends at the skin boundary is profoundly misleading, and misrepresentative of our embedded-ness within the larger living system that is our ecosystem. We are not separate from Nature, and never were; some are just pretending so.

For those without much access to wilderness, even a single houseplant to look at, to take care of, to befriend, can help us reconnect with a fundamental part of human nature.

A correction - as much as the Schumann resonance exists, there is no substantial evidence of it being employed on spacecraft for the aforementioned reasons.
