It struck me yesterday how total the left hemisphere dominion is. All our life tied to some number or others: grades, or money. Can people even imagine how life was before things were quantified? Before it depended on some number? Living in a diffuse blob of feeling.

Reading a book about grading, and I’m struck by how grades and testing are just taken for granted as inevitable. If we can’t “imagine the world as though it might be otherwise,” as Maxine Greene would say, we are stuck with the bizarre customs and habits our systems have adopted.

Those moments when things weren't so cut-and-dry, when all those discrete barrier fade into the background, where the self doesn't feel so confined to some numbered expectation, to a limited space, feel absolutely amazing for me. And it's something that's innate in us, to boot.

It feels hilarious to me sometimes that what people call enlightening is mostly recovering our right hemisphere mode of functioning and bringing it to the foreground. Such incredible rewards sitting behind such a simple process.

eg "Tanha", usually translated as "desire" or "craving", is described below left (by Romeo Stevens) as "zooming in" or "grasping".

Lo: these are left-hemisphere moves!

Or how we've historically traumatized ourselves into relegating one of our two modes of functioning (seeing the world) into the nonsense box. We've lost so much, and the answer was always sitting within us. Psychedelics help us reconnect w/ourselves; part of why they're so good

It might just be that a long time ago people were so in their right hemisphere that voices in their head were taken to be the voice of gods.
Have we reversed the situation nowadays? Living so much in the left hemisphere that any time it shuts up it becomes a mystical experience

I keep thinking about this exchange between Jill Bolte Taylor (who had a stroke that left her temporarily with only a working right brain hemisphere) and Iain McGilchrist:
(the left hemisphere is the one mostly devoted to speech)

This gal was living continuously in a state of bliss simply from her left hemisphere being forcefully shut down. It seems that's what we're seeking when we have to "quiet the monkey mind" or suspend thought, judgment, resistance, grasping.
