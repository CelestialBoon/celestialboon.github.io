1. Welcome to my domain, creatures of the night. I will share upon you my wisdom of psychic endevours and so on. <b>Beginner psychic stuff, advanced psychic stuff, astral experiences and more.</b> I have had much experience in the search for truth and promise. Some of these points have been taught, some of these points I have come to know from experience. <b>I&#39;m a strange individual,</b> my methods are strange but for the most part down to earth. If I&#39;m getting some info wrong which I dare not share if I disbelieve it&#39;s useful nor do I intentionally try to put forth incorrect information, do let me know. I don&#39;t have omnipotence.

6. <b><u>The words of a monk that appeared in my dream regarding telekinesis</u></b><br />&quot;You must feel the aura, see through it, and pierce it with yours. Focus your energy on it as a whole, and lift with your spirit.&quot;<span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 12:55 AM">(edited)</span></div>
<div class="msg-content">
7. <b><u>Aerokinesis Technique</u></b><br />The technique I use for this is a bit different than Atmokinesis, but uses the same element (Air) to manipulate it. Honestly this is much simpler than changing the weather, and the effects can be almost immediate. The same cautions apply.<br />Ground yourself. Reach out, and feel for the space around you.<br />With your intent, push forth this intent through your dominant arm and up through your hand. &quot;Feel&quot; the direction of the wind surrounding you.<br />Command it so, for the wind to change its direction. Imagine that the wind blowing upon you will suddenly cease, or imagine the flow of the wind to change direction.<br />Push out with your force and into the space around you, your intent.<br />That&#39;s mostly all there is to it. You just need to imagine with your intent, the direction of the wind that you can feel, change.<span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 12:55 AM">(edited)</span></div>
<div class="msg-content">
8. <b><u>Atmokinesis Technique</u></b><br /><div class="pre">[Caution]: This is for advanced users. Messing with Mother Nature&#39;s furniture can have global consequence if you don&#39;t do this right.<br />1. You must feel for the environment you are in. The location, the presences around, the way the weather currently is. This also includes but is not limited to, where you are in the world today and in the universe, and the time where you are.<br />2. Think very carefully upon the time frame you want this to occur. Changes in the weather can be anywhere between 5 minutes to a few days.<br />3. Feel for the direction of change you want to happen. It is also important to note that sudden and dramatic changes in the weather are less likely to have an effect.<br />4. Channel your energy both upward into the sky above, and down below towards the Earth. <br />5. &quot;Feel&quot; for the desired change to occur, and the time, and the location. All these need to be felt for in unison.<br />6. It is important to note the direction of the wind, and the clouds - for these events to occur.<br />7. Release these desires into the Earth and the sky.</div><span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 12:59 AM">(edited)</span></div>

9. <b><u>My thoughts on Conjuration</u></b><br />Though I don&#39;t know much about conjuration myself, the most common act of doing so would to summon a familiar / spirit animal. Sort of like divination, except your familiar will be a little something like a ghost pet. There are probably many resources on the internet to do so, but summoning one based on your spirit animal will ensure that your familiar is most compatible with you. It does not require to eat, but you must still take care of it. <b>Do not ignore it or it may come to hate you!</b><span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 12:59 AM">(edited)</span></div>
<div class="msg-content">
10. <b><u>Constructs</u></b><br />Creating a construct can be simple and fun. Here is a basic technique.<br />Imagine yourself in your mind-globe. <br />Daydreams are nearly the exact same. They are constructs of ideas in your mind.<br />Set forth upon in your space, perhaps a platform below you, or an object in front of you - a three-dimensional object, with color, and texture, and material.<span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 12:59 AM">(edited)</span></div>
<div class="msg-content">
11. <u><b>Hosting: Pt. I; Setting forth boundaries</b></u><br />It is important to note, for tulpamancy, and hosting; that you <b>must</b> lay down some boundaries and guidelines for the others within.<br /><b>&quot;These are the laws of using my body.&quot;</b><br />It can be simple, like always let you use your five senses, or that you must take back control when you so demand it.<br />Perhaps some gender-related boundaries, such as no kissing another of your gender.<br />Or instruct them not to go through memories unless it is a must.<br />Simple things and so on.<br />Next reassure that consequences will follow if they do not follow your wishes.<br /><b>&quot;So mote it be.&quot;</b><span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 12:59 AM">(edited)</span></div>

12. <b><u>Hosting: Pt. II; Switching</u></b><br /><div class="pre">1. Concentrate internally, on the presence of the one you wish to bring forth.<br />2. Pull, pull with your will and might, bring forth them; If nobody is in control your body will go into a state of basic automation - you will continue to breathe, or walk<br />3. Step down, push their presence out throughout your body, switch and put them forth amongst control<br />By step down I mean, release yourself of control of your body and senses for that moment, and fill the void with their presence.<br />4. Speak internally, do not attempt to continue to control your body.<br />5. You can assume control of your body again through your will. In the meantime, let thoughts be said, let them and their essence speak through you.<br />[!]: Echoes are what are described as moments of one&#39;s presence overriding another, imposing a momentary thought or speech.<br />6. You can leave your senses &quot;open&quot; to be able to be sensed by multiple of your individuals.</div><span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 01:05 AM">(edited)</span></div>
<div class="msg-content">
13. <b><u>What is a Presence</u></b><br />Presences (or spiritual pressure) generally encompass simple details about an individual- their emotional history, their morality, their kin, and a generalistic sense of their power.<br />Details about ones presence can be leaked from something as simple as a message, giving away details about the persons emotional state and tone.<br />Other details such as whether you knew that individual in your past life and gender may also be present<br />When you think of someone, it often comes with a general feeling of that individual, how you perceive them - whether or not they might be awake - even where they are in the world; this is essentially a placemarker for someone&#39;s consciousness and can be used to link to them, heal them over a distance, and do other things.<br />The closest example to this in anime would be Goku&#39;s Instant Transmission (Dragon ball series) where he can teleport to an individual instantaneously so long as he can feel their presence.<span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 01:05 AM">(edited)</span></div>

15. <b><u>Basic Thermokinesis for Tap Water</u></b><br /><div class="pre">1. Hold out your index and middle finger under the water.<br />2. Your index finger for the top, and your middle finger for the bottom, in the stream.<br />3. Use your index finger to draw out the heat energy, and your middle finger to amplify your intent to make the water turn cold<br />4. Continue to pull out the heat energy from the water, within seconds it should turn to a nice, ice cold temperature, and enjoy.<br />I use the technique I just posted quite frequently, because tap water is always luke warm</div><span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 01:05 AM">(edited)</span></div>
<div class="msg-content">
16. <b><u>Mastering Precognition</u></b><br />Precognition/Foresight/Fortune Telling mostly has to deal with <b><i>probability.</i></b> In other words just because you foresee a <b><i>probable future, does not always guarantee that will be the outcome.</i></b> There are many things that can change between then and now.<br />➖ The shorter the distance to the probability, the higher chance the outcome.<br />➖ Sometimes this can come in dreams. It is important to note the events or details that transpire in random dreams with individuals you know.<br />➖ &quot;Bad feelings&quot; are sometimes caused by your precognitive gut that something bad will happen.<br />I begin by focusing on the distance to an event, relative to the time and place.<br />The more specific you get in your event, the more likely it is to change.<br />It&#39;s also possible to be able to determine what actions you can take to avoid a specific outcome, or achieve a desired outcome.<br /><b>Sometimes you can go beyond. You can see many futures, many of them occurring the same. The more paths you see in that direction, the more likely it is to happen.</b><span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 01:06 AM">(edited)</span></div>

17.<b><u>Barriers, Pt. I: Classification</u></b><br />➖ <b>Class I Barrier</b><br /><span class="pre">A low-class barrier that prevents small things like psychic attacks. Naturally intelligent and stubborn individuals put up walls in their head on their own.</span><br />➖ <b>Class II Barrier</b><br /><span class="pre">A barrier which can prevent a wider array of things, including entities, on the etheric level.</span><br />➖ <b>Class III Barrier</b><br /><span class="pre">A specialized barrier, preventing many things. Strengthened, and often masks the user&#39;s presence.</span><span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 01:06 AM">(edited)</span></div>

18. <u><b>Barriers, Pt. II: Understanding planes</b></u><br />It is important to note where you put your barrier.<br />➖ Mind-Globe<br /><span class="pre">This is your internal space. Your thought center. Your, imagination room. So to speak. Putting a barrier here will prevent psychic attacks.</span><br />➖ Wall-Barrier<br /><span class="pre">Effective on the 3rd and Etheric Level. Keeps out narsty spiritos</span> &#128077;<br />➖ Aura-Barrier<br /><span class="pre">You can hide your aura and presence from others,</span> <b><span class="pre">but this does put stress on you.</span></b><br />➖ Astral-Barrier<br /><span class="pre">Psionics vamping your butt?

<div class="msg-content">
19. <b><u>Become Unnoticeable</u></b><br />This somewhat classifies as illusion. Useful for when you don&#39;t want your teacher to call out your name in class.<br /><div class="pre">1. Concentrate. Feel the air around you. Your peers. Meditate, relax. Focus.<br />2. Slow down your heart rate. Focus on your aura, slowly changing to mask off that static atmosphere around you. The key here is to make yourself appear unseen in the eyes of the others.<br />3. Dim your aura. Dim your presence. Give off that stagnant energy that says hey, that guy&#39;s presence is so weak and unnoticeable it doesn&#39;t cross my mind.<br />4. It will help to imagine yourself as transparent as air. Become one with your environment.<br />5. At the more basic levels, you should attempt to be very still.<br />6. A tip, you might want to make a &quot;net&quot; of sorts around you to know when you come into someone&#39;s field of view.</div><span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 01:06 AM">(edited)</span></div>

20. <u><b>Terminology I; The wandering soul</b></u><br />➖ ES<br />Energy System. aka Astral Body, Soul<br />It is your consciousness, your &quot;double&quot;, the body from which you project into the Astral realm and dreams with.<br />➖ EM<br />Energy Manipulation.<br />➖ Energy<br />Is also known as Chi, Qi, Psi, and Ki. The ability to manipulate this energy is called Ergokinetics.(edited)<br />➖ Etheric (plane)<br />This is the first layer of Astral, closest to earth. Think of this as the flip coin, the realm where ghosts and spirits walk through.<br />➖ Entity / Being / (Sprite) / Soul / Spirit / Kin<br />All <i>parts</i> of the same cookie.<br />➖ Link<br />This is something like opening up a portal or an access to information.<br />➖ Regression<br />The capability of reverting to an older state of being. This usually entails memory loss as well<br />➖ Ascension<br />There are two definitions of this word.<br />One is the commonly known definition of Ascension. The first definition of ascension is the capability to multiply one&#39;s energy output, which commonly comes with a different form as well. It is similar to &quot;Going Super Saiyan&quot;.<br />The second definition is as the Egyptian variation describes. It is &quot;Going up a state of Consciousness&quot; to a more complete state, usually at the end of one&#39;s life.<br />These two definitions are very similar to each other. In order to achieve an ascended state, one must have lived a full lifetime.<br />➖ Awakening<br />The process of &quot;waking up&quot;, from passive dormancy to obtaining the full capacity of abilities and memories of their past life. The awakening process is often described as what drives one to continue their spiritual quest.<br />➖ Pocket Dimension<br />A 4-dimensional construct where a small space fits an even larger space within it. Kitsune are known for their tails containing pocket dimensions.<span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 01:06 AM">(edited)</span></div>
<div class="msg-content">
21. <u><b>Common Ascension Classification</b></u><br />➖ PsA/x<br />Pseudo-A/x. The border between A/x and A/y. Attributions may be shaped out of Ki rather than taking full form.<br />➖ A/0<br />A form that is entirely human in appearance.<br />➖ A/I<br />A form that is mostly human, with smaller attributions including but not limited to, cat ears &amp; a tail, wings, horns, etc.<br />➖ A/II<br />Some call this &quot;True Form&quot;. This varies greatly on the individual&#39;s dominant kinship. For example, an anthromorphic form, such as a humanoid fox, or humanoid tiger, or humanoid jackal; Etc., these forms can be very unique, or very common. It is quite noticeably without a doubt, different than a human form, but retains a degree of human figure such as height and the capacity to stand upright.<br />➖ A/III<br />Some call this &quot;God Form&quot;, others &quot;Titan Form&quot;, and so on. It is a level of state that few are able to achieve. These forms heavily tax the user&#39;s stamina, and thus cannot be maintained for long durations easily. It is important to note that most bodies are incapable of fully housing the energy output of these forms, and using these forms often result in being &quot;Ejected&quot; or forcibly bi-located from the body. The appearance of these forms vary greatly upon the user, however most are a considerable amount taller than the previous form.<br />➖ A/IV<br />This is a level above. It is nearly impossible to achieve. The appearance not only depends on the user, but the type of emotional energy from which these forms tap into. Remaining conscious in this state is improbable. Serious harm can come of the user&#39;s mind without exercising extreme caution.<span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 01:06 AM">(edited)</span></div>
<div class="msg-content">
<b>Advanced. You don&#39;t need to worry about this until you <u>at least</u> know what your kinship(s) are.</b><br />They basically describe the level of output your Energy System projects. Your Energy System can take on many forms, it is <b><i>the equivalant of &quot;Super Saiyan&quot;.</i></b> Remember folks, this isn&#39;t DBZ. It&#39;s not a &quot;tickle in your neck&quot;. You must achieve this when you&#39;re ready. <b>First-generation souls are incapable of accessing ascension forms.</b></div>

Something that provides you with comfort. Your primary affinity is not one that must take priority over other elements. You may have natural weaknesses to other elements for your practice. For example, pyrokinesis can be less effective in rain. Gravity counts as the element of darkness and electricity counts as the element of light. It is often to keep a balance of your practices throughout the elements.<span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 01:06 AM">(edited)</span></div>

It looks... and <b><i>tastes</i></b>... Mmm.. Good &#128076; <br />Fry it up in a pan.

It&#39;s not like you can <b><i>simply, walk into the blood storage and reak havoc.</i></b> No, you must be very selective of the person you bite into.<br /><b>Do not <u>exchange</u> blood with a non-vampiric being.</b> This is how turning begins.

35. <b><u>Types of Meditation</u></b><br />➖ Mindfulness Meditation: The most well-known type of meditation, mindfulness meditation, is about being aware of the sounds and activities happening around you. It&#39;s almost a flow-like type of meditation, because you literally just let your mind be fluid and flow from one thought to the next, not really focusing on one particular thing. For instance, if you live in a noisy city, you don&#39;t have to block out the outside sirens and screaming children, you let your mind be aware of the sounds without becoming too focused.<br />➖ Spiritual Meditation: This type of meditation is for those who regularly participate in prayer, as it&#39;s based on communicating with a diety. Just like the other styles, you must become calm and quiet and then begin to focus on a question or problem you might have. This style of meditation can feel not only relaxing, but rewarding as well.<br />➖ Focused Meditation: If the idea of clearing your mind of all thoughts stresses you out, focused meditation is great because you can focus on a sound, object, mantra, or thought. The key here is to just focus on one of these things and stay committed to that one thought or object. This is when relaxation music comes in handy. Even though you&#39;re essentially using your mind, you&#39;ll be amazed at how rejuvenated you feel afterwards.<br />➖ Movement Meditation: Movement meditation may seem intimidating, but if you&#39;re by yourself and you really get into it, it can be extremely uplifting and relaxing at the same time. Sitting with your eyes closed, simply focus on your breath and try out different gentle, repetitive flowing movements. Rather than focus on a sound, object, or thought, just turn your attention to your movement.<span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 01:11 AM">(edited)</span></div>
<div class="msg-content">
➖ Mantra Meditation: Mantras are words that are chanted loudly during meditation. It may seem odd to be making loud noises during a meditation session, but it&#39;s actually the sounds that become the object being focused on. In yoga, the mantra Om is regularly used since it delivers a deep vibration that makes it easy for the mind to concentrate on that particular sound.<br />➖ Black hole meditation: first, relax the body and close your eyes. visualize the thoughts of the day is being gathered in your head. then visualize a black hole forming and sucking those thoughts where they can&quot;t escape, and visualize the black hole exploding, leaving your mind in darkness and with no disturbances. this is a fast way to meditate and this does work.</div>

Don&#39;t force yourself or overconcentrate.<br />5. Avoid the afterimage trap - get your friends to wear white<br />6. Look for subtle color impressions than solid or vivid colors.<br />7. Try comparing friends and their auras<br />8. A persons auric field depends on their state of relaxation, get your subject to breathe in and out deeply and see the difference<br />9.

You want to be able to catch projections of images, thoughts/ideas, or audio. Clear your mind.<br />2. Focus on the presence of the person you wish to project conversation to. &quot;Listen&quot; for their voice, and make a connection of sorts, like a line of energy connecting to this individual.<br />3. Speak with your internal voice, clearly and distinctively. Hear your words in your mind. Direct them outwards towards the individual, either from your crown chakra, or your third eye, sometimes to the pivotal point of your mind; Whichever works best for you, so long as you&#39;re able to project forth your thoughts to that individual.</div><span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 01:11 AM">(edited)</span></div>

You can turn your body and you can still feel that region moving across your body. It has that feeling of death.<br />You can also use a pendulum with an answer sheet to try communicating with spirits nearby, <b>much safer than a ouija board.</b><br />Or, you can see if you can pick up energy vibrations in your pendulum, it may swing in its general direction.<span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 01:14 AM">(edited)</span></div>

Vibrate your Ki onto their line, feeling for how receptive it is.<br />2. Go down along the back, hands say 3 inches apart. Radiate your healing Ki along the spine, imagine the vein from which this Ki flows enlargens and strengthens.<br />3. Push forth up this flow of Ki up the back, and into the shoulder blades, with your hands. You want to build up this force that pushes upwards.<br />4. Pull this Ki energy, vibrating all throughout, cleansing, opening;<br />5. The more you &quot;knead&quot; along those lines, the more effective this flow of energy.<br />6. At the center point of the arm, bring all of this energy through and allow it to pulsate and circulate through.<br />7. Trace this energy to the hands, and take out the negative blockages to be released back into the Earth.<br />8. Repeat, pull this energy forth through the body while sensing the vibrations it gives off, allow the energy to pour out through the palms.<br />9.

If you are within the flow of time of these physical constructs, how does one detect when time has ceased for that brief moment?<br />It is like putting your computer into sleep mode. Everything the computer is doing is put on a temporary hold until you command it to turn on again, putting you into the exact same place, the exact same moment, and the only way the computer knows time has changed is because of the constant ticker of the CMOS battery. If you removed this component, it&#39;s almost as though <b>the computer never went to sleep at all.</b> Rather, it was put into a form of stasis, but the programs inside won&#39;t have a clue that this happened at all.<br />Many <b>don&#39;t notice</b> this affect in the universe, for that reason. <b>But if you can predict when it&#39;s about to happen,</b> you can <b>take advantage of this action.</b><br />Take advantage of this fundamental flaw in the construct of the universe which you reside in.<br />Say you are in a physical fight, your opponent momentarily becomes disorientated as they readjust to the shift that had just happened throughout the universe. You can use this as an opportunity to strike your opponent, or even begin a momentum of movement at the fraction this event occurs. If you did, congratulations - you have moved at a speed so fast, so parallel to this break in all things, you have struck your opponent before they even begin to process the thought in their mind.<span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 01:22 AM">(edited)</span></div>

<b><u>Empathy advice</u></b><br />You have these gifts for a reason ♡. There are many moments when you&#39;ll feel drained because of how much social energy is going around in a conversation.. You&#39;re alright love believe me. Take a moment to ground yourself. Yes your emotions are definitely affected by what everyone experiences around you. If a feeling is too strong just take a moment to ground, breathe and relax. Meditate for a little bit and try to understand why the other feels this way, if you&#39;re moving past a sensitive subject and another brings it up just patiently try to say that we&#39;re all past that subject and reassure that if the person would like any advice or background that you can provide that you can share it at any moment. Having negative energies like depression and anger can drag a lot of people down with them because we all have empathy. It&#39;s hard not to fall down with them I know. But try your best to keep positive and maybe make a joke upon your discretion and reinforce positivity and happiness. This can also happen when you read text as well so what I do to cope is look something up on Google that might be funny or otherwise bring light into the darkness that&#39;s clouded over you. Stay positive but stay calm and collected as well as respectful and try to understand why they might feel this way, you don&#39;t need to have a cure to their problem just having an ear to listen is sometimes all they need ♡</div>

88. <b><u>What are your affinities?</u></b><br />Your affinities are the elements your soul is most in tune with. There are 5 primary elements, and 5 secondary elements. We&#39;ll be working with 4 primary elements today (Earth, Air, Water, Fire).<br />**Green<br />White<br />Blue<br />Red**<br />These are the colors associated with those 4 elements. What you will need are 4 stones of those colors. They can be anything, but the specific type of rocks/crystals can be fairly expensive, in the meantime having colors of these onto rocks or marbles works well.<br />Note that the colors of the rocks/marbles you collect should be vibrant in nature. Variations of these colors can mean something along the same lines as the element that you&#39;re trying to sense for, but have different attributes.<br />For example, light blue marbles can represent ice, an attribute of the water element.<br />For that reason it is recommended not to have variations in color that are not fully true colored to the elements you are attempting to sense for.<br /><div class="pre">1. Place a stone in your hand.<br />2. Intend to find out the nature of your elemental power. How does this make you feel? Do you get a rush of energy? Do you start to feel weak? Does it hurt your hand? Do places of your body begin to feel odd?<br />3. Those that feel more energetically in tune to the stone, may have a natural affinity to them. Those that feel like they are in pain, or get odd feelings in other places of your body - this may not be suited for you, it may be a weakness, or an element you must work with later down the road. Those that feel almost nothing at all, you will have the most difficulty with this element.</div><br />There is another method that encompasses all primary and secondary elements called the <b>Infinity Star,</b> which I will post about later.<span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 01:23 AM">(edited)</span></div>

89. <b><u>Dream Space</u></b><br /><b>All dreams take part in Astral.</b> Whether you realize this or not.<br />There are 3 (known) ways to get to the part of astral that is not your <b>Dream Space / Dreamscape.</b><br /><div class="pre">1. You go to sleep, and you are immediately, intently, reawakened inside Astral, skipping over the dream space entirely.<br />2. You become lucid, and make a shortcut / doorway into another part of Astral.<br />3. You reach the edge of your dream. You&#39;ve strayed far from the course of your bubble and you cross that boundary.</div><br /><b>There are countless dreams that you won&#39;t realize you&#39;re in a dream and ergo unable to access these parts.</b><br />However this explains why some people have &quot;full dreams in 30 seconds&quot;; Astral has many parts that operate at higher or lower rates of space-time. If you are unfamiliar with this concept, you can probably google Time Dilation, even Stephen Hawkings recognized this phenomenon in the universe where certain areas have &quot;accelerated time&quot;.<br />Because your dream space is co-constructed by your mind, soul, and astral, asking the right questions like in Inception, can give you wise answers.<span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 01:23 AM">(edited)</span></div>

90. <b><u>Astral Void</u></b><br />It is simply nothingness. These voids exist in various places, various spaces; Only the energy of your ES can be seen as a glowing figure. It&#39;s a good place to practice meditation, among other things such as using it as a shortcut to get from one part of Astral to another; However navigation is obviously limited, and travelling in these parts can be tricky to get out of unless you know what you&#39;re doing.<br />This is also the space rumored to have countless souls being trapped after death. &quot;The end of existence.&quot;<br />Unfortunately, <i>most full human beings go to this space after death, to slowly dissipate and become one with the universe.</i> At least according to what I&#39;ve been told.

91. <b><u>Hosting: Pt. III; Memory-spaces, and identifying sources</u></b><br />Most of the time when another entity has entered your body, you will gain noticeable mass. This mass can be described as spiritual pressure / presence. All thoughts have a little bit of one&#39;s presence within.<br />If you host, you <b>must</b> train your mind to recognize and realize the origin of any thoughts, imagery, ideas, etc., (which can also help with becoming aware of psychic attacks such as imposition.)<br />You <b>must</b> train your mind to <b>record the presence of each thought</b> as you / your other(s) continue on daily life.<br />Making a space in your mind to have each collection of memories &quot;auto-save&quot; to that space will help greatly in organizing your thoughts and emotions. Having all those memories recorded in the same space can be troublesome, especially if you have <i>many</i> souls residing within you looking for references if say your mother walked into your room and you need to remember the body&#39;s name or where you are. Yikes. As a result the ones I host suffered a couple times, unable to process the names of the individuals they spoke with while they were in control.<br /><b>I recommend if you are a host to meditate for at least a good hour to &quot;format&quot; your mind so that needed information comes easily, and your memories don&#39;t get scrambled.</b><br />This somewhat also applies to tulpamancy.<span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 01:24 AM">(edited)</span></div>

<b><u>Deep Diving</u></b><br />Deep-diving is a concept for entering one&#39;s soul plane, in other words digging very deep into the other person&#39;s presence. This takes a lot of time and practice to achieve, and it helps to have empathy to achieve it. <br />You&#39;ll get information like,<br /><span class="pre">Morality, type of being, mental state, emotional history, and power level.</span><br />Morality is one of the first things you will notice.<br />Type of being can be something like light-energy or dark-energy orientated.<br />Mental state, how they&#39;re currently feeling about themselves.<br />Emotional history, like if you&#39;ve had trauma in the past.<br />Power level, many are able to sense when another being is very strong.<br />You can even go as far as to see visions of the past, let it come naturally to you. Make sure your third eye has energy. You might get a lot of information at once doing this, but remember that to deep dive can also mean to see their best and worst events in their lives. It is very personal and I don&#39;t expect nor recommend to do this without consent. You can find really deep, personal issues, and of course, if you aren&#39;t adept at sensing or projecting - simply don&#39;t do it.<br />1. Feel the presence of the person you have in mind. It gets easier to get information the more you interact with them.<br />2. What kind of vibes do you get from the person?<br />3. Follow these and dig deep, deeper, all with your mind.<br />4. You should be immersed in very dense energy, a very unique landscape like a little bubble where only sprites and the core exist.<br />5. Begin by imagining you are in the person&#39;s shoes. You need to get information relative to when you are right now and the past you are trying to look for. Looking at a watch to get a sense of the flow of time by the seconds is recommended.<br />6. Try your best to describe the imagery you see. You know there are certain vibes and thoughts that play when you get this information.<span class="msg-edited" title="04-Apr-18 09:59 AM">(edited)</span></div>

They are placed by the most evil of entities.<br /><span class="pre">Seals</span> are something where you can keep something bottled up for a while, they can be to protect you or to keep explosive power contained. You can pretty much guess what seals can be from there.<br /><span class="pre">Fragmenting</span> is something you should never do. It&#39;s like when Lord Voldemort put his soul into holcrux. You should never do this unless you have a very good reason to do so.<br /><span class="pre">Regression</span> is to go back to an earlier state of being, it can sometimes help with healing, or remembering something deep from the past - it can also be to revert personality, and memory. <i>Sometimes</i> this is temporary.<br /><span class="pre">Curses</span> are something that can be permanent if left be.

Relative to you, leave your body. Try for as much vividness as possible.

There are a variety of uses for Ki balls; Training, healing, tapping someone on the shoulder. If you&#39;re not very good with Energy Manipulation, practice this at least once every day. It can be used for fighting and astral interaction, but just a simple Ki ball is often not enough for sustained action.<br /><b>WikiHow</b> also has a resource on this, additionally I will share my technique.<br /><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Psi-Ball">https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Psi-Ball</a><br /><div class="pre">1. Gather energy around your solar plexus, reach out with your mind for the energies of the Earth with the energy of your intent.<br />2. Build this energy, use your higher judgement in grounding. Cycle these energies then outstretch with your arms, keeping tensity through your muscles.<br />3. Open out with your arms, then guide your hands to a close. Sense for the electromagnetism between them, do not touch the other hands. You should keep your legs bent and uncross.<br />4. Push your force out, expelling this energy to the in between of your palms. Use your senses, imagine this energy you feel to &quot;fall into each other&quot;, folding, compressing. Circulate this energy, do not leave it still. Center your energy around the core in a manner that rotates the excess energy in a circular or spherical motion.<br />5.

96. <u><b>Scanning</b></u><br />Morality, empathy, natural talent, if life has been cruel or unfair, positive and negative flows of energy, darkness and light, general personality, how timid one is, near future events and troubles of the mind; <b>These are all of the things that come within the presence of an entity,</b> and may be easier to sense over time. This stumbles upon some more advanced concepts; It takes use of your empathy when it comes to sensing issues in the <b>now.</b> Doing so also gives you a sense for the rest of their presence.<br /><b>All that you can see of a person vibrates these waves of emotion and presence.</b><br />All the energies you feel will flow through the words of the person&#39;s text or imagery. Try to get a sense for this vibration and compare it to tone as you read through it. Remember that words are not auto-completed by an autonomous machine, each fragment of time can be seen throughout the text like a long string of different colors.<br /><b>Seeing an introduction or a starter is often a good way to sense for energies of when they first came to a place.</b><br />Some can argue that this is observation, but one&#39;s first impression is always important. Not only does this lend out the representation of the being they want you to see, but all that is hidden in the background as well. The emotions that went into making it, the struggles with their words.<span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 01:25 AM">(edited)</span></div>
<div class="msg-content">
<b>Begin with the now, then work your way down.</b><br />Morality, light, dark, positive, negative. What kind of a person do you feel?<br />Retrocognitive individuals, begin by reaching back. The harder it is to reach further back to childhood, the older they <i>may</i> be. Keep in mind that maturity is very different than age.<br /><b>Look at the presence as a whole, and use your empathy to see their emotional path, from the beginning of their lifetime to the now.</b><br />It is important to note the many things that variate in every day life, what is life in the day of this person? What <i>was</i> life in the day of this person? It may be easier to cover your searches in years..<br /><br /><b>Above all, trust your intuition.</b><br />Inaccurate readings are given when you doubt your power, or don&#39;t follow through with a part of the reading. There is much more you can learn from an individual by their presence, such as kinity, but kinship scanning is a topic on its own. It may help to be aware and have been in the presence of entities of that nature. Eventually you will get to the point where you can look at someone on the bus, and strangely know almost everything about them</div>
<div class="msg-content">
Continued. <br /><b>Remain focused.</b><br />The more people that are actively about during the day and around you, the more difficult it is to give a good scan. You shouldn&#39;t do it when you&#39;re extremely tired or exhausted.<br />Reach out into their past, their times at school are also important. Look at the words they speak, or the vibrations you feel; Try to interject yourself in between these vibrations, down to the spectator&#39;s level where you can see the flow of changes. Were they accepted? Did they have troubles making friends in the past?<br /><b>You may get bursts of visions.</b><br />Your empathy in these situations is more important than the visions you perceive. Trust your instincts, follow the rabit down the rabit hole. How often do you feel waves of hidden negativity in their past?<br /><b>Morality can be hidden.</b><br />Look for signs of a trollish nature. You know very well what a troll is like, and what kind of vibe they give off. These individuals tend to have less morality and more evil intent.</div>
<div class="msg-content">
<b>Look at synchronicity.</b><br />It is important to look for whether or not depression has struck their life, what kind of a person they became out of it all. How far has one strayed from the path of life? They can have strokes of bad luck, feel cursed or destroyed. These kinds of negative feelings radiate more brilliantly than most. Imagine their presence in the form of a railroad. How many times have they gotten off the tracks, and kept going along side it?</div>
<div class="msg-content">
<b>Look for the empathy within them.</b><br />It is a feeling we get when one has put much thought and effort into forming their responses. Feel for this flow of time in the manner in which they have written the representation of their thoughts., Is it to comfort someone, or is it to put out the friendly facade of trust? Is it something they would rather not be doing, but feel obligated to do so? Include this in your observations if you&#39;d like.<br /><b>What is their gender?</b><br />Quite often this will be reflected in their presence, but because of hosts and tulpas as well as other beings that may be around them, it&#39;s not always accurate. It may help with exploring deeper into someone&#39;s presence, however this should generally be disincluded unless it&#39;s obvious.</div>
<div class="msg-content">
<b>The Cell Method</b><br />This is what I like to call the Cell Method. It is where you take a drop of their presence, the energy that was already leaked out, and compare those vibrations to an event or scenario. How would they respond? What is the feeling this &quot;cell&quot; gets, in its reactions or vibrations to this change? Doing this is incredibly useful for scanning, it acts as a comparison that can be done without observing much of the individual you are scanning. Consider the following situations.<br />➖ Making friends<br />➖ Willingness to learn<br />➖ Timid/Shy Nature (Embarassing Questions?)<br />➖ Breaking up.<br />➖ Elligant discussions<br />➖ Job Interview<br />Remember that the more mature the situation, the easier you can identify whether or not someone is mature or of an older age. It will also be your window to retrocognition for events that have already past, perhaps how frequently this comes up in the path of life.<span class="msg-edited" title="06-Apr-18 12:52 AM">(edited)</span></div>
<div class="msg-content">

This is for the most part what it means to scan an individual. It requires former knowledge of things such as energy manipulation and extra sensory perception. &#128076; <br />I hope this helps with scanning. You can practice with those around you silently, like on a bus. Doing this with friends is less recommended simply because you have a deeper connection with them that you already know well.</div>

100. <b><u>Aura of Invisibility</u></b><br />When I say invisibility in this sense, I am of course meaning your metaphysical presence is that of one that isn&#39;t there. You will not be noticed in an environment or in a classroom even, solely the requirement that you do this technique right.<br /><div class="pre">1. Sense for the variables in your environments. The people. The spiritual presences. The teacher down the hall. The time. The general place in the universe.<br />2. Try to feel the difference between your passive environment and the environments reflected upon you that can be observed.<br />3. Feel upon your aura all of the fields of view around you. Try to follow each to their point of origin. This will partially step into the boundaries of another entity.<br />4. Manipulate your presence. Try to emit the lowest amount of presence as possible. Make yourself &quot;invisible&quot; in the terms that your being can be glanced at and passively turned away from. <br />5. The presence that you leak out must change to match the present of the passive environment around you, this can be achieved by pushing forth the energy of the environment onto the spectator&#39;s field of view.<br />6. Imagine yourself invisible like air. All uniform throughout your body. Slow down your heart rate, stabilize your breathing. Try to omit no sound, make no sudden movements.<br />7. Lastly, dim your aura as much as you can. This is a dangerous thing to do. Please exercise caution.</div><br />You can get so advanced in this, you can even raise your arm to say you&#39;re present in attendance, but you will be marked down as away.<span class="msg-edited" title="17-Apr-18 01:25 AM">(edited)</span></div>

<b><u>Awakening natural talent</u></b><br />Your natural talent can be physical or metaphysical. It doesn&#39;t have to be something overly complicated or advanced. Close your eyes and meditate. I want you to ask yourselves these questions.<br />What is a power you wish you could do?<br />What do you know would be a power possible to yourself?<br />When you have something in mind, practice with a very trusted friend or on your own in secrecy. Write down what you feel you can do, and just try to do it ^-^ there are no wrong answers here. The first who used telepathy didn&#39;t learn from someone else, It was a power in their mind they knew they could do. Anything you can imagine can potentially be something you can do in the future or have done in the past. Experiment with this, and I would like to see what awakens in you ^-^</div>

<u>Sleep Record episode 2: Chronokinesis</u><br />The first dream was chronokinesis. There was a lab of sorts, had many bridges to this one centered machine with many cables attached. You could look down from the traffold to some dark and deep sublevel. I had arrived with 2 individuals, let&#39;s just say &quot;red&quot; and &quot;green,&quot; they had weapons such as rocket launchers and so on. At this point I was busy simply walking around, but immediate chaos ensued. I found myself witnessing the destruction of this strange laboratory.

I tried to do that myself, ended up being that I could. Same sort of feeling with the wind except this time it was more of like a &quot;grabbing&quot; sort of energy. I tried doing this immediately after I woke up but failed.<span class="msg-edited" title="18-Apr-18 09:18 PM">(edited)</span></div>

The ones screen was completely minimalistic, running things more similar to a very advanced calculator. There was a lineup of people, a wall with 6 red buttons behind them with neat vertical decorative panels of different various functions. There were two projected screens playing various music content and otherwise. I go up to the guy and I ask if he has acid.<br />The guy gives me a tiny chip for a cell phone in a bag.<br />I say well this isn&#39;t what I paid for.

112. <u><b>Combat Senses I</b></u><br /><b>Extrapropriokinesis/Extraproprioception</b> is the ability to scan for damage on an ally or entity.<br />Concentrate on the presences around. You will need to get an approximate location of your opponent. The same kind of pain waves are emitted off an opponent&#39;s presence as they would be for your own being. The main difference is that the &quot;encoding&quot; so to speak will be in tune with the wavelength of the individual you wish to scan. Some might be harder to scan than others. It&#39;s alright. The more sparring you do, the more apparent these &quot;pain&quot; waves become, and should be allotted to you as phantom pains over their inflicted areas. The hardest part at this point is differentiating between your pain waves and another&#39;s.</div>
<div class="msg-content">
<b>When you strike your opponent</b> here are some things to consider while trying to recognize the impact.<br />➖ Direction<br />➖ Force<br />➖ Pressure<br />➖ Will<br />➖ Movement Speed<br />➖ Presence</div>
<div class="msg-content">
99% of the time, The <b>force</b> from your <b>Ki,</b> is momentum of your <b>will</b>. The more will you put into an attack, logically the more you should feel. If you don&#39;t sense any <b>pressure</b> from the <b>force,</b> upon the intending combative areas (fist, knee, etc), you may have missed your target.<span class="msg-edited" title="19-Apr-18 12:43 AM">(edited)</span></div>
<div class="msg-content">
<b>Movement speed</b> and <b>direction</b> are equally as important. Some can hit targets without putting much effort into the direction, but this will be very important for your non-visual senses. If you mismatch the <b>Movement speed</b> of your opponents <b>presence,</b> it becomes harder to block an attack or strike with accuracy.</div>
<div class="msg-content">
<b>Remember</b> that you are gifted with 6 senses.<br />Touch<br />Sight<br />Sound<br />Smell<br />Taste<br />ESP<br />You&#39;re going to want to focus on the most important aspects of this, most importantly..<br /><u>ESP</u><br />Your extra sensory perception such as scanning. The pressure of the entity&#39;s presence is critical to maintain a focus on. But this is not everything. There can easily be clones of one&#39;s presence which then you&#39;ll be aiming in the complete opposite direction of your opponent. This is an advanced technique and defense strategy.</div>
<div class="msg-content">
<u>Sight</u><br />While not as but still fairly important is sight. <b>Its easier to visualize an opponent when you can sense them.</b> This sensory is less so important than your ESP.</div>
<div class="msg-content">
<u>Sound</u><br />Lastly I&#39;ll cover sound. There are lots of things to be heard in a fight. You might hear a &quot;pop&quot; every now and then in your hits or steps. Having this is arguably as important as sight though. Recognizing sound in battle can be a critical aspect of your surroundings.</div>
<div class="msg-content">
It is important to note that when I say ESP, I&#39;m encompassing a wide range of astral senses, Including but not limited to;<br />➖ Extrapropriokinesis<br />➖ Empathy<br />➖ Mass<br />➖ Momentum<br />➖ Gravitational<br />Anything you can <b>use</b> to give you an edge.<span class="msg-edited" title="19-Apr-18 12:55 AM">(edited)</span></div>

116. <b><u>Advanced Combat: Lightning Punch</u></b><br />This will require previous knowledge of energy/Ki manipulation and flash stepping. The reason why it requires flash stepping even though there&#39;s a million ways to go about speed in Astral whether it be 5D teleportation or QE is because the acceleration of mass at high velocity increases the amount of force delivered in a blow. I&#39;ve been doing this for a little while now (actually you can &#128077; this if you&#39;ve seen me do it before in some way), I&#39;ve used this in my soul weapons to increase the amount of force in many situations.<br /><div class="pre">+ Acceleration Flash-Stepping</div> This is simply my way to do this and like all other things take it like a grain of salt.<br /><div class="pre">1. While throwing a punch, imagine every linear instance phasing back and forth, but not actually moving your astral body.<br />2. Build up this force, and with Ki.<br />3. This upcoming force which you are channelling through your astral body gets infused with the brightest light you can think of.<br />4. Intent like that of a strong magnetic force to shoot and repel all of this energy about to be expulsed. Ley out a pillar that will vibrate this energy throughout your structure for which part of your body you want this energy to be channelled through.<br />5. Be sure to keep focus on this as it can cause damage to you. Don&#39;t expulse too much energy or you can vibrate your astral arms and legs into oblivion. You need to keep in mind the action you are about to perform, and have estimated how quickly you need to move.<br />6. Keep low. You must walk before you can fly. There is also more energy lost for getting that high off the ground.<br />7. When you expel this energy imagine compressing all of this energy into a singular point that will generate distortions at a gravitational level. </div><span class="msg-edited" title="24-Apr-18 09:12 PM">(edited)</span></div>

Imagine like the Etheric layer is a mirror of the current third dimension, <b>and more,</b> those who are beginning to Astral Project will realize that there are very similar differences even in Biolocation, but there are <b>a great many differences all the same.</b> For example, your room right now may be twice as big in the Etheric as it were in the Physical, or have a little portal in the corner to another realm/dimension/area. There are a great many possibilities, even half materialized floating buildings, things from the past with a strong spiritual presence, and more.<br />Your aura is both apart of you and apart of the Etheric world. <i>A little birdie</i> told me that you need to <b>make use of your aura to do things such as technokinesis, electrokinesis, telekinesis, and more.</b> Though know the risks, as you may end up tainting your aura, poke holes in it, and other damages that can be very dangerous to you. I would say use such an ability in moderation if you are capable of doing so. Bilocation/Biolocation is similar but not quite the same. Your aura is the energy field that surrounds your body, to which encompasses your spirit. So the risks are quite understandable.<br />I have gathered this knowledge both from experience, witnessing others use this, and of the knowledge I have recently obtained.

Some only see balls of colored energy, some can scan chakras, some can sense the pain or see the damage of others; I would like to point out a few things on how <i>I personally experience scanning</i> and the methods I personally use.<br />➖ I sense the presence/background energy/spiritual pressure of an individual through text.<br />➖ I use this to target the individual for the intent to scan. I may get within an observational distance of someone&#39;s soul.<br />➖ I take a look at their basic emotional history, something that leaks through texts and other posts and interactions, such as morality, light/dark, if life was fair or cruel<br />➖ I align myself to their energy, where they are, and I put &quot;shells&quot; over myself that acts as haptic feedback from damages which I feel quite well, and can usually differentiate this using the presence &quot;encoding&quot; that comes with the shells<br />➖ Sometimes I delve into their past, like past lives, and kinship, but that&#39;s more advanced and frankly something I don&#39;t do often<br />➖ I use their presence to take a quick look at their near future<br />➖ I use the method previously described where I test a small piece of the lingering energy against a couple scenarios<br />➖ I compare it with other energies to see what suits them best such as if they&#39;re more inclined to be near nature<br />➖ I open myself up to other beings in their vicinity such as pets and spirits or loved ones &quot;pinging&quot; around with my energy over a small radius of the individual that wishes to be scanned<br />I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve covered all of my methods but these are what I mainly use.<span class="msg-edited" title="27-Apr-18 08:06 PM">(edited)</span></div>

The more you see auras the further your sight will be; do not try to force anything, in time seeing auras will be natural and on demand.

125. <b><u>Ghost Ping</u></b><br />Alright. This is more so based on personal experience and a bit technical. Words I&#39;ll use to describe things you&#39;ll have to go with intent. First things first there are three more or less states of ghosts that I&#39;ve generally encountered.<br />➖ Friendly spirit. It won&#39;t try to bother with you much. The vibes of like &quot;feeling&quot; a snowflake in the background.<br /><i>Generally They will have a presence to something like that of like the environment you&#39;re currently in.</i><br />➖ &quot;The ghost&quot;. There&#39;s a feeling like a chill in the air. The heaviness of something like a ray of moonlight, something that says you&#39;re not alone. You sense it in the air, that other things are nearby. You feel like you&#39;re more self aware, that you don&#39;t want to speak.<br />➖ &quot;Reds&quot;. May be heavily influenced empathically by it&#39;s energy. You may even tear up. The wind sometimes roars amongst the darkness in the trees to urge you to go home. Nature is bending to the negative mass of energy nearby. Chills go down your spine, very powerful pockets of memory echoes; weird things happen.</div>
<div class="msg-content">
<u>The technique</u></div>
<div class="msg-content">
What you need to do once you get used to making Ki balls is make smaller sharded pockets of Ki, like a cloud of dust that will signal patterns of light etc. Back at you. Start with meditation, you need to get used to the natural energy around you. Start with this weird cloud Ki ball as building up Ki drawing energy from your legs up to your solar plexus and out to the shoulder sides of your aura. Collect this energy and compress it till it is nice and distributed over a small radius relative to you in the universe. When you pulse this energy out keep on mind that you want to be magnetic to any walls or ground, but the same polarity for the energy of death or something abnormal to the area. After sending this out, in my own experience, friendly spirits have changed (from green to gold,) this energy wave which was very noticeable which allowed me to focus in on that location to investigate further ..</div>
<div class="msg-content">
&quot;The ghost&quot; seem to have more yellow and sparattic distortions in this bright cloud of energy you emit, and &quot;Reds&quot; are <i>to my perception</i> when this cloud of energy (turns from green to red), and faded into some of the energy around you.</div>

Ultimately if you&#39;re able to reconnect with this distribution of energy, you should be fine. You can map out the distortions based on something like echolocation using this technique in conjunction with sensing where and when it comes back to your aura. Give this some practice and time, if you&#39;re used to the energy of spirits then I&#39;m sure you have a nice way of doing things too. Like a pendulum. Anywho if you&#39;re not used to the energy of spirits here is what those energy signatures are.<br /><br /><b>FRIENDLY SPIRIT</b><br />like someone got killed and is just a lil lonely and sad. <br /><br /><b>THE GHOST</b><br />Likes to dart everywhere, or is really hyper or excited. It might have some bad thought or two.<br /><br /><b>REDS</b><br />Like how there&#39;s a breeze in the air in an abandoned mineshaft. It is totally black. You turn on your flashlight and the PA system comes on speaking in a weird 70s alarm system voice in something not quite comprehensible. You look left with your flashlight to a jingling sound and it&#39;s these weird chains coming out of the ceiling but there&#39;s one in the middle that&#39;s rattling about violently while the others stay still.</div>
<div class="msg-content">
That gave me the shivers just typing with that energy</div>
<div class="msg-content">
Realistically you can probably find some haunted photos somewhere online if you&#39;re good at scanning that sort of thing it&#39;ll pop out. On the topic of EVPs I&#39;ve been considering getting an EVP recorder to test that out myself, I would also like some EM measuring devices which would be beneficial, I have one on my phone as a sensor built in; I heard tape recorders and bluetooth devices especially react to these kinds of energies and actually my Bluetooth cut out lots of times with the medium energies.</div>
<div class="msg-content">
I&#39;m sure there are other notable ways for detecting ghosts such as incanted sensitive compass or what have you. But be warned places with lots of violent dead energies manifest bad things. Graveyards especially get the feeling of death as medium types can stay near their graves for long periods of time. But the most dangerous would probably be an entity that can bend physical reality that violates physics. I&#39;m talking about something like you were a dummy and locked yourself into a haunted abandoned hospital from the 50s and when you try to open the door you only find not the exit but.... more hospital. Your watches become irrelevant to the relative linear time of Earth and well you&#39;re going to want to be able to get the fluffy out of there.</div>
<div class="msg-content">
<b>In conclusion</b> all the types have the similar hint of death energy or negative energy. I mainly covered the types of ghosts I&#39;ve encountered and some experience with them with energy links; how they feel against me may not necessarily be what you feel, I&#39;m not you. You&#39;re gonna have to observe carefully and figure it out for yourself in most cases. <b>if there is a certain topic you would like me to cover</b> let me know.</div>

126. <b><u>Energy of Death: the plane of dreadnaught</u></b><br />Those that have experience will notice that there are certain times when it feels like below the ground beneath you little pockets of death energy slowly roam around from time to time. They are not to be confused with reapers, as reapers are anyone that banishes or for lack of better words get rid of at a level of physical disturbance, and hence it is a title. Dreadnaughts in the old stories go like this. They are walking beings of death energy. Most are fairly neutral. They feed upon the energy of stray ghosts and other kinds of smaller spirits that cross their paths. Rumor has it that for everything devoured a piece of its energy becomes appended to their cloaks as another piece of string.<span class="msg-edited" title="06-May-18 07:41 AM">(edited)</span></div>

I&#39;m covering this topic because, have you ever looked at the weather channel and been yeah right, when are they ever accurate? Alright well I&#39;m going to share with you a couple tips.<br /><b>Start with trying to read the presence of the wind.</b> Often the wind will carry energies far away; they have an originating location and a sense of relevancy.<br /><b>Does it smell &quot;damp&quot;?</b> It may indicate coming rain.<br /><b>Direction and flow?</b> The wind can carry emotions and intensity; it may affect nearby trees to rustle in a certain way. Keep an eye out and use your empathy.<br /><b>Keep a listening ear.</b> There are many things the wind can tell you. It may take a while to get the hang of it, but once you do, you can predict the weather, and temperature, and &quot;see&quot; the direction of the wind.<span class="msg-edited" title="11-May-18 01:57 AM">(edited)</span></div>

Like an outer shell that absorbs whatever you&#39;d like so long as you program it correctly for the jobs you want it to perform.</div>
<div class="msg-content">
It is wise to construct it in a way that <b>remains independent</b> of you, but follows wherever you go. <b>Be sure to make it ground and recycle the energy it absorbs.</b> you don&#39;t want it to explode. You don&#39;t need to fragment <b>and shouldn&#39;t</b> for the nature of this system.<br /><div class="pre">1. Ground, draw in the energy of the earth.<br />2. Start with a condensed line of energy, then drag it around till it makes a circle around your astral body, like a long string of glowing energy.<br />3. Intent and keep in mind all of the things mentioned above. You can customize it to your needs. Think of it as the wall between you and the open worlds.<br />4. Importantly make it follow you but never touch you. It&#39;s going to absorb a bunch of nasty stuff after all.<br />5. The most important part would to be that it should draw in any and all of those nasty negative things like a sponge and try to either redirect it towards the earth or try to tank it and deplete itself of negativity once you ground it. Make this an extension of you but DO make sure it has it&#39;s own degree of independence so that it doesn&#39;t affect you.</div></div>

129. <u><b>Echoes</b></u><br />There are different kinds of echoes and of course I&#39;ll talk about them a little because those that have come to know plurality will experience something like an active memory. Arguably there are different ways to deal with this situation but for myself I simply accept it for what it is and move on.<br />➖ Lover&#39;s Echo<br />➖ Spirit Echo<br />➖ Plurality Echo<br />➖ Memory Echo<br />➖ Family Echo</div>
<div class="msg-content">
<b>What is an Echo?</b><br />An echo is something more or less a thought or an action or a surge of energy which may or may not result from natural causes or otherwise. It is something that may or may not be yours. Such as why are you thinking of a past memory in a time like X, or Wow that was unlike me at all.<br />Plurality echoes in particular can have many causes. Merging/fragmentation, the host consciousness not taking enough position in their soul seat; It can be imposed on a singular entity and may be quite noticeable, such as the internal voice of a deceased being or past life. I personally believe that each echo has meaning and is coming to you as the universe gives you a &quot;push&quot; to make some self aware decisions that invokes critical thinking.</div>

129. <b><u>Infinity Loops</u></b><br /><b>Note that these were concluded from experience.</b><br />The bottom line is, the answer to the universe and everything is an answer so complex, because the nature of the question, and the nature of reality itself, are not so different apart. To put it quite simply, it is something like infinity. If you understand what it means to see Infinity, to see every branch of possibility, causality, and duality; Infinity, for the infinite number of infinite spaces that drive us forward - the simplest and most linear way to answer this question, from a non linear perspective; is that infinity is the power of pure creation itself. Those who know infinity have a hard time trying to explain it. The universe may not want you to know it. But once you find, and <b>understand</b>, and have <b>experienced</b> infinity - it is at that point, when you have reached a unique omnipotence to be able to know, and manifest, any reality, in any number of ways; with the infinite number of possibilities colliding between existing, not existing, and everywhere in between. Time travel becomes possible, because you are looking at any number of realities in the past, or the future, in all branches of reality.<span class="msg-edited" title="08-May-18 02:56 AM">(edited)</span></div>
<div class="msg-content">
Higher dimensions like astral indeed run on frequency, and positivity. In the dimension beyond this one, linearity only exists to a single nexus of space and time. A plane where anything possible is possible, has been created in an infinite number of ways, an infinite number of small differences. But the experience is bound to the finite conscious, placing the <b>utmost importance on positivity</b> in dimensions higher than this one.</div>
<div class="msg-content">
To chase this question, and to have answered it; takes something like a great many lifetimes of experience; You cannot chase the answer of infinity, because you will always chase this answer to infinity; It requires a perspective <b>beyond</b> corporeal existence to in depthly understand fundamentally everything. The universe in linearity doesn&#39;t want you to know. It&#39;s why it isn&#39;t talked about often. Existing in an infinity loop is like existing in a higher dimension, it is the higher dimension. To understand the nature of infinity, is to understand fundamentally how all things in this world, have come to be; Once you truly grasp what this is, you will have learned ascension.<span class="msg-edited" title="08-May-18 02:59 AM">(edited)</span></div>

I am not even in the same reality as when I started out in anymore. I have time travelled to and back the edge of finity, in a sea of infinity. There is the infinite, and there is the finite consiousness. There are rules to the construct of reality that binds us and plays itself based on the fundamental laws of physics, and quantum mechanically any number of variations can exist anywhere in between;</div>
<div class="msg-content">
Thus brings me back to the conclusion in summarization of the knowledge obtained this far; I have coined my own terms for the devices I have used to navigate through this sea. The loop if ininity itself is this; To understand infinity is both impossible to remain existing in this reality as it is to fully exist in every possible way and thus to infinity. It is a higher dimensional construct that cannot be understood on the base level of thinking (you) are acustom to. It exists in a state of superimposition; It can be broken but my nature it will spread out evermore so to infinity, and thus the loop of infinity; and the finite loop of consiousness to infinity. To understand infinity is to walk the path of infinite and finite realities; Your higher self knows fully well what this means, and that the future does indeed affect the past and vice versa;</div>

The image I will post is <b>only a slice</b> of intermixed realities in a beautiful cascaded web of ???? - I have seen many different versions across time and space of this image.

136. <b><u>Furthermore: Hyper Sigil Effectiveness</u></b><br />Arguably there are many ways to increase or ensure the effectiveness of a hyper sigil. What I strongly recommend is having grounding lines, so that it doesn&#39;t overload whatever you&#39;re doing. As you&#39;ve noticed I have little <b>&quot;grounding nodes&quot;</b> throughout the constructs. I find that this is <b>critical knowledge</b> to have because if you can&#39;t take in all of the energy at once, bad things can occur, particularly overloading. You should have the same or <b>more</b> grounding lines in comparison to the ley lines which you draw energy from.<br />If you link it somewhere, make sure that you put in with your intent of such into your lines through and through; Every shade and line with each piece you&#39;re adding in - whether to strengthen it or whatnot.<br />I use <img class="emoji" title=":infinity:" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/443293551535718400.png" /> as a computational matrix of sorts, based on the intented details around it. Of course, the construct always must have strong meaning to you.<br />Lastly, just give it a little &quot;spark&quot;, a &quot;jolt&quot;, of Ki.</div>

<i>scratches head</i><br />All I&#39;m gonna say is ✋ ✋<br />I have had a lot of experiences and it&#39;s accelerated in a very short time.<br />I have seen and dealt with &#128064; a ton of stuff.<br /><b>Like <span class="mention" title="snowball#9825">@snowball</span> said we&#39;re all dumbasses in a way,</b> because I <b>still</b> don&#39;t know everything, and I never will know <i>everything</i>. I have had very good things come from trusting myself, and part therein always asking questions and being in the presence of others with their shared knowledges and experience, <b>personally confirms for me some of the things I have come to know about myself among other things.</b><br />&#128076; That&#39;s fair, yeah?<br />We don&#39;t all have the same words for the same things. We don&#39;t all have the same level of experience or expertise. You can #######, ignore this channel <i>all you&#39;d like</i>, I&#39;m <b>not</b> forcing you to be here &#128064; <b>furthermore,</b> <br />My advice and guidance has sincerely lead to helping people if even for a perspective. Having a fair degree of struggles has pushed me to acquire <b>more</b> than what I&#39;ve been used to.<br />All in all it&#39;s mostly <b>experience,</b> and <b>asking the right questions.</b> Intent and <b>understand,</b> because one thing can easily be called another thing.<br />Decide for yourself what is right &#128064; <br />If you bring up existential questions about my personal being, <b><i>Look at my damn soul</i></b><br />&#128076; <br />&#127383; <br />Do what you must, but just stop talking if you try to insult me like I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about &#128064; there is such a thing as miscommunication and perspective.</div>

137. <b><u>Astrika</u></b><br />I have created a blueprint for a construct which in turn is a sigil that you can summon at any time; I call it Astrika, a combination of the Greek translation for astral camera.<br /><b>What it does</b><br />It&#39;s a giant, floating brick, haha. When you call upon It, the construct should be noticeable; It&#39;ll emit a unique energy signature and dissipate once you&#39;re done analyzing whatever you&#39;re scanning.<br />It&#39;s the equivalent to a giant MRI machine but for energies and vibrations that your spirit can translate onto (paper) all of the vibrations that bounce off an astral object or individual;</div>

Additionally, as you can see in the diagrams above; it can measure things like the maximum energy radius, time/space dilation and distortions, approximate age, last action, author, stabilizers, grounding, ley lines, unique energy signatures, elements, curses/hexes/bindings, morality, nature of the object in question, gaps between vibration patterns, gravity, shape, material, density, and even color; of course using this device gets easier in time, <b>it&#39;s fun to play with.</b></div>
<div class="msg-content">
Other things can be done with this too like following psychic links and so on. I am giving it a bit of artificial intelligence to record new data and improve over time. <b>Astrika</b> is available to use for anyone, will attempt to telepathically communicate all of this data; it has a grounding mechanism and an infinite capacity to scan and be summoned. It is quite versatile, and easy to use; it can be combined with other constructs, and scan multiple things at once. Your intent is the controller. You can use it to scan anything from ghosts to astral objects. Because it&#39;s efficiency increases with each use and becomes custom to each individual using It, the possibilities are almost endless</div>
