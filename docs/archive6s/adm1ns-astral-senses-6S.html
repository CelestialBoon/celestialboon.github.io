<u><b>~ Mushin No Shin ~</b></u><br /><br /><span class="pre">First:<br />Breathe in and let yourself run out of breath 3-5 times<br />You should get a pressure in your body when you do that.<br />Now when you are breathing in tense up all of your muscles.<br />Breathe in, tense up, let yourself run out of breath until your body gives you confirmation of something through pressure.<br />Basically, a slight feeling of light headedness.<br />Second:<br />Breathe in, tell your feet to relax, breathe out<br />Breathe in, tell your legs to relax, breathe out.<br />Continue this until you get to scalp or top of head.<br />And then say &quot;mind relax&quot;<br />The change will be very great.<br />Third:<br />This is how you enter mushin no shin.

~<br />This is a very basic form of grounding that you can perform before getting the hang of it, for me it opened up the concept of it quit a bit . I recommend to really, really, try it. <br />It only takes a minute and grounding is one of the key aspects of staying level headed...<br />remove confusion from energy being stuck in your skulp that have nothing to do with &quot;now&quot;.<br />The issue gets stronger as your drawing in more and more energy during your progression- if you don&#39;t perform this. <br /><br />It&#39;s in my opinion, one of the most important factors in Spiritual growth.<span class="msg-edited" title="29-Mar-18 11:15 AM">(edited)</span></div>

<span class="pre">Dreaming...</span><br /><u><b>Lucid Dream At Will</b></u><br /><br />Well. First of all, it&#39;s sort of tricking your subconcious that you are about to fall asleep.<br />First thing first, you are aiming for your body to inject itself with a poison that shuts of your muscular system. <br />You do this by controlling your mind/thoughts and not get caught in emotions. <br />For example deep meditation, only listening to your heartbeats - it&#39;s hard not to fall asleep when you get close....<br /><br />I tend to have two thought in my mind &quot;Not fall asleep, focus on &quot;breath&quot;&quot;<br /><br />Your mind/subconscious will control if you are actually falling asleep or not.<br />Making you feel like moving, turn side, etc- To check if you are.<br />If you don&#39;t turn to temptations and don&#39;t flood hormones by getting emotional in your thought patterns. <br />Your body will start to produce this &quot;poison&quot;, making you incapable of moving muscles/paralyzing you. <br /><br />From this point. <br /><span class="pre">You should instead try to focus your eyes - in a set point in the darkness. <br />Your mind will start producing hallucinogenc - including natural dmt. <br />This will create - dam dam dam - Hallucinations. <br />It&#39;s important to not &quot;look&quot; at the hallucinations - beacuse then they vanish. <br />Instead you should just &quot;look forward&quot; - &quot;not moving eyes, focus&quot;. <br />Allow the hallucinations grow - until a &quot;world&quot; is formed. When it&#39;s strong enough...</span><br /><i>.......</i><br /><u><b>Congratulations. Move around in your Lucid Dream</b></u></div>
<div class="msg-content">
<span class="pre">Scanning</span><br /><b>Scanning Practice</b><br /><br /><span class="pre">Scanning is something you do constantly, either subconsciously or consciously- the trick in scanning more efficiently is loading this activity into your consciousness and improving the interpretation from &quot;trial and error&quot;. <br /><br />Good practice for this, on something like Discord - is to try to interpret every vibe/energy output you can find in texts, etc. Let&#39;s say some new user that you haven&#39;t encountered earlier types a text.<br />Try to trust your subconcious about simple emotions attached to the output of that text... Example;<br />&quot;Is this person angry? Is this person sad? What gender does this person have?&quot; - etc<br /><br />Then sometimes you get the chance to see if you were right or not. This is the time where you can check and improve your interpretation of said energy you felt.<br /><br />This is a good practise before you actually start to make former personal scanns.</span></div>

<span class="pre">Astral Projection In Depth</span><br /><b>Astral Projection</b><br /><br /><i>Read previous guide on how to achieve muscular shut down/numbness....</i><br /><br /><span class="pre">To give a more in-depth guidance on how to move past from this. Start of with picturing your room/environment. <br />You can do this for 20~ minutes or so, depends on how used to it you are....<br />Try to grasp every detail in your room, picture - picture - picture. Using your third eye. <br />Next step; Get a feel of your astral body inside your body.<br />This should be way easier, once your body is numb and you have this mental open picture of your surronding.<br /><br />Feel the toes, feel the hands, feel the vibrations, feel the form of your human adapted form soul. You can do this for a good time, until you really feel like it- No matter if you are experienced in moving it- more time grants bigger chance of success... <br /><br />Next step; <br />Push your soul upwards, push energy below you - a good meter or so upwards. Look around in your surrounding that you detailed in your mind- take things slowly. <br />Grasp the differences in the vision from your new point of view... This will help you to mentally understand that you are no longer in your body. <br />Move around a bit, inspect your environment.... <br />Once things settle emotionally and you understand that you are no longer a part of your body. <br />You should be good to do whatever pleases you in the astral realm.</span></div>

<span class="pre">Astral Vision</span><br /><b>Part 1; Cleansing your Third Eye</b><br /><br /><span class="pre">Try to locate your Third Eye with energy management...<br />It should be placed almost in the center of the skull, a bit further to the front.<br />Get a feel of the energy&#39;s being stuck there... <br />Try to remove bad energy&#39;s, you could do this by creating a &quot;filter&quot; / &quot;flapper&quot;, with the property to only &quot;smash&quot;/&quot;take with&quot; the unwanted energy&#39;s. Make sure to put a bit of soul in the creation of this construct and it&#39;s property&#39;s. <br /><br />Another way of doing it, is imagine this &quot;energy-center&quot; like a magnetic field, where you push energy and out of it- almost like the Earth works. You can speed up the energy going outwards and catch it, spiraling it away from the &quot;third-eye&quot;. <br />Release it down your feet&#39;s -&gt; ground / grounding....</span></div>

<span class="pre">Astral Vision</span><br /><b>Part 4; Tips, Tricks &amp; Practise</b><br /><br /><span class="pre">The most important part, is to let go of thoughts - and completely zone in to trusting your intuitions. <br />You want to turn of your mind, and just experience. <br />Analyzing can be performed after experiencing. <br /><br />More important, than the most important part;)<br />Practise... Practise... Practise... <br />Doesn&#39;t matter how long your path to getting there are, <br />if you have the will- you are bound to make it. <br />The universe guarantees you that!<br /><br />Don&#39;t allow your mind to limit you. <br />You have 360&#176; vision with your third-eye, play around with this. <br />Look around you, look at several directions simmultanesly- this is good practice for detaching your mind, while performing inner experiences.</span><br /><br /><b>Accuracy</b><br /><div class="pre">1. Take 0.1 second snaps with your third-eye<br />2. Fetch information from your subconscious, from what you just perceived <br />3. Trust your intuition in said fetch<br />4. If available, control with feedback- To help easen the trust in your vision. </div><br /><br /><b>Recommended practice.</b><br /><br /><span class="pre">Carefully detail every bit of information/detail in your most common surrounding. <br />Detail, detail, detail- create this surrounding- copy the objects into the astral. <br />The more you build this surrounding, the easier it will be- to have this place as a starting point and practice area. Look at my Astral Projection guide, for a more thoroughly explanation.</span><span class="msg-edited" title="03-Apr-18 02:14 PM">(edited)</span></div>

<b>Sensory Meditation</b><br /><br />I would highly recommend to everyone to throw in sensory meditaiton in their daily routine. It&#39;s personally and to others i have spoken to the most effective method of identifying and exploring other dimensions of yourself, the astral - and your energetic body. <br /><br />Sensory meditation boils down to dissioating with your physical body and entering <i>&quot;observer&quot;</i> mode.</div>
