In itself, a *tulpa* (as it is meant in the Western definition, not the Tibetan one) is an independent, co-habiting thoughtform. It can be thought of as an imaginary friend on steroids; eg. one who reliably and intelligently talks back.

Tulpamancing, or the practice of creating, raising and living with a tulpa, is a relatively novel concept, having come into niche popularity only around 2012.

Since then, a community has formed around this practice, sharing experiences, iterating on concepts and techniques, and in general pushing the envelope of the exploration of human consciousness. As it stands, it has collected many guides and techniques on what can be seen as very interesting, novel and powerful ways of relating to oneself. It opens the practitioner to the existence of wide, wild and alive spaces within the self, and even if the reader isn't interested in having some other guy in their head, the toolbox alone that the practice provides is immensely useful as means of self-exploration and self-discovery.

Many communities exist to this day to house discussions and guides on tulpamancing. If you're looking for a guide on it, my recommendation of a good starting point would be Within's [Tulpanomicon](//tulpanomicon.guide/).
