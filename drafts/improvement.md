it works like this, everywhere I've heard it spoken
to get good, the absolute quickest way is to focus on improvement, and not goodness as an absolute
if you can look at something you've done and be able to tell what you could improve on, and find ways to improve on those things, and do it the next time, then you're basically unstoppable
do enough of that and you can get anywhere
you get in that mindset and you'll blow past any goals you might have considered initially and you'll be ready for more because you'll be in the mindset that you can always do better, and that it's a good thing that you can

you can become at peace with that idea, and you can just enjoy the process as it is
the core of this is of course, what could keep you going through it? And the answer is that some people just naturally stumble into a process that lets them enjoy improving themselves
for others it might take some work, but improving yourself is definitely an activity anyone can put themselves in a position to enjoy

pay attention
investigate thoroughly
expand your awareness
exclude assumptions
log down stuff, especially the night
plan things, get into a routine of novelty, if it sounds hard to do, great, you're compressing the hard stuff, and you're doing it in a manageable way

and refresh your motivation, find some grounding, FIND STEPPING STONES and use them to make your progress stick
this is super imporant, as partial as your progress can be, hold on to it, build on it to reach greater heights still. As much as you can drop one for the next, keep at least one to build upon
