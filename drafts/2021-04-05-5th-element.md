It's struck me that Western alchemy has four elements (the classic fire, earth, air and water) as basis of physical existence while Chinese alchemy (Wu Xing) has five. Over time, I've noticed that most systems indeed contained 5 elements, such as the hindu elements of pritvi (earth), jalam (water), agni (fire), vayu (air), akasha (space); or the onthology of the African Dagara tribe, (contained in the book <i>Of Water and Spirit</i>), where indeed, five elements are confirmed as the physical foundation, and exactly those of Chinese alchemy: nature (wood), fire, earth, stone (metal) and water.

It felt bizarre to me that such a gross mismatch could exist about something so foundational. But then I also remembered that *there is a fifth element to Western alchemy*, which is appropriately named **quintessence**, which is Æther, the "breath of the gods"; the subtle, rarified substance of the celestial spheres, the stuff of Spirit. It is easy enough to associate to other "fifth elements", such as Spirit, or Space (the Hindu akasha). Turns out even the Western alchemists and philosophers were keen to the five-fold nature of the physical world, which is observable in such blatant displays as the existence of exactly five platonic solids.

While this clears some confusion, it still does not justify why Western alchemy's common treatment of one element is so much different from the others. The four elements are tightly interwoven, and form cycles of generation and destruction by transitioning from one to the other, but the fifth remains more elusive and more rarified; a substance that is not of this world, and instad resides outside of the usual transformations of spacetime.

Looking a little deeper into it, I noticed that the Wu Xing (and the Dagara ontology with it) also has a 4+1 structure to its classification of elements, in more than one spot. For example, as far as the cardinal directions are concerned, Water is associated with North and Fire with South; Wood is at the East and Metal is at the West. The same applies for the four main seasons: in the usual Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter order, the elemental correspondence goes Wood (Spring), Fire (Summer), Metal (Autumn), Water (Winter). At the center of both systems lays the Earth, an element that has a different quality than the others, being the harmonizing, equilibrium force; for the four cardinal direction, Earth lays at the center, and for the four seasons, Earth sits at the four transitional periods (of 18 days) between each pair of seasons.

Looking deeper still into it, the modern structure of the Wu Xing is a Confucian creation; before that, Taoism was the widespread Chinese philosophy, upon which Confucianism was based, and the very obvious message of Taoism is that the world of existence is structured in dualities, with Yin/Yang as the archetypal, baseline duality.

The rest of the Taoist description of reality continues upon this binary code. The cycle of generation and destruction has four parts to it: the young and old Yang, and the young and old Yin; or looked in another way, the Yin-transitioning into Yang, the Yang proper, the Yang-transitioning-into-Yin and the Yin proper. This four-partedness to the system is also represented in the iconic symbol, having two big color regions plus two dots of the opposing polarity contained within them.

This binary nature goes further still; the eight Taoist elements are based upon the 8 trigrams, and the nature/quality of time can be accurately portrayed with 64 descriptors, corresponding to the 64 hexagrams of <i>I Ching</i> fame.

So what does the fifth element stand for? The common thread I've noticed about the fifth elements of the disparate philosophies, the odd-one-outs, is that they're either the highest or the lowest one, the spiritual Æther or the humble Earth. Some alchemical concepts should be able to shed light on this.

### Alchemy, Love and the descent of Spirit

> The father of all perfection in the whole world is here.  
> Its force or power is entire if it be converted into earth.
> Hermes Trismegistus, Emerald Tablets

The guiding narrative of (Western) Alchemy, which is contained within the Emerald Tablets, is the incarnation of Spirit into Flesh; the manifestation of ideals, meaning, of Sense, into material reality, with Spirit as the architect, Mind/Soul as the builder, and the body and its creations as the material embodiment. The end goal of Alchemy is the realiztion of the ideal dwelling-place for Spirit within physical existence; to transform the mere matter into something beautiful, harmonious, <i>meaningful</i>, for our Spirit is the carrier within us of Meaning, of Sense, of all the higher ideals that we superimpose onto an otherwise simpler existence.

AND YET—Death waved a hand. AND YET YOU ACT AS IF THERE IS SOME IDEAL ORDER IN THE WORLD, AS IF THERE IS SOME...SOME RIGHTNESS IN THE UNIVERSE BY WHICH IT MAY BE JUDGED.

The integral role and highest aspiration of a human being is thus to be the bridge between the two realities, of Matter and of Sense, and to fill the former with the latter, in the same way we recognize the beauty and value in music and, through the use of sound waves, we manifest actual physical music that we spread throughout the world.

Through this lens, it makes sense that the fifth element would have to be something relating to Spirit in a more direct and unequivocal way. In a metaphorical sense, the role of the alchemist is to harness the quintessence in order to make use of it in phisical reality.

#### Then what about the Earth? 

On the other hand, the Earth has very little to do directly with Spirit, but in the Chinese and Dagara ontologies, it has very precise and interesting traits. Earth is the nurturer; Earth is nutrition; Earth is the one who feeds fair and wicked alike; Earth is our shared ground of Being; Earth is the harmonizer; Earth is the carrier of unconditional love. Earth is, essentially, the Mother.

In this light, it is easy to see how this can be put on the other side to the "father of all perfection," the Father Sky. While the more masculine side of Spirit contains the qualities of inspiration, direction, and guidance, the more feminine side concerns nurturance, support, and acceptance. And we find those two sides in spades in the two depictions of the fifth element.

These two sides to the descent of Spirit into Matter 

like an octahedron

this thing is that is dual but not really of the manifestation of Spirit, the nurturing, the power, the meaningfulness, the high that descends into the below but not really because the low doesn't exist per se, so it's the act of illusionary filling

## Metal vs Air

It's needless to say that Western society is very intellectualized; the mind is romanticised to the point of veneration, fetishism and excess, and countless things fill our head continuously, easily to the point of overcrowding. Collectively, most Western people are heavily skewed towards the Air element, which fills our lives as tirelessly and as pervasively as the very air we inhabit. How curious, then, to notice that the closest equivalent in Chinese alchemy is the element of Metal, which is indeed connected to breathing (and the lungs), but also to the cutting motion; to discernment, to separation, to defense, to routine, to reaction. The more I looked into Metal as an element, the more I realize these are qualities that are also ubiquitus to the point of overabundance in Western society.

Closely related to Metal is **po**, the facet of Shen (ie. the Soul, ie. all the higher faculties of mind and sensation) which is related to the inward movement, to the descent into matter, to the personal (as opposed to the universal), as well as a very familiar set of faculties:

- Sensorial perception  
- Reactivity
- Routine and repetition
- Defense from that which is dangerous
- Instinctual will-to-live (the po is the part of the soul that melts into the Earth at death)

All of which are over-prominent in Western culture, which is very materialistic and centered on the physical senses, very routine-focused (to the point of becoming slaves to the clock), very self-centered and overly attached to life (to the point of disrespecting and thus breaking the life-death cycle in countless ways, enough to merit a wholly separate essay), and also <i>very</i> focused on matters of defense, self-defense, dealing with threats and dangers, esp. the kind that needs iron to settle.  
An overly-working **po** sees threats everywhere, and is thus prone to worry, paranoia, and anxiety, just in the same way that Metal generates Water, which is the element associated with fear and all its derivatives. Wars are overly prominent in our narrations of history, and outside of human-on-human conflict, it's all war on this, war on that, be it drugs, terrorism, crime, some virus...  
Things around here are very prone to being framed as a matter of conflict and needing defense. It is the Western hammer that makes everything look like a conflict nail.

"[Po] expresses the idea of a continuous pressing urge ([po] 迫) on man" (tr. Needham and Lu 1974:87), and the restlessness of Western man is notoriously without equal.

Very prominent in Western culture is also the connection to metals, and in particular iron. We're just crazy for iron; on its back we rode from the Iron Age all the way to the Industrial Age, and further beyond. Metallic are the webs that we lay across the whole planet, for transportations of materials, energy, and data. Metal are our chariots, our wires, our pipes, our lairs, our machines of all sorts. The world of the Western man is often referred as the world of iron in indigenous cultures.

Metal is that which cuts, that which separates, that which gathers, which reflects itself in a culture which has been historically supremely violent, that is built over unprecedented resource extraction and gathering, and that also makes people feel very separate and alone and disconnected.

Pertaining to Metal is the emotion of sadness, of dejection, which is so endemic in our culture as to be normalized; it's the water in which we collectively swim. As a culture, we are entirely ok with the idea of people living a life they are dissatisfied by and sad about; that's just how Western life goes. Connected to Metal issues are psychic disturbances, **depression**, allergies and asthma, all of which are disturbingly prominent.

## Wood vs Æther

So what about the other parallel between Wood and Æther? Why is it that this fifth element is treated much more as an aside than in other cultures, for starters? One answer appears quickly enough, since in the wu xing, Metal regulates Wood, which means that an overabundance of Metal in turn polices and suppresses the expression of Wood. The two imbalances are deeply connected.

Wood is the Chinese element of spring, and the one which we would most readily associate with plant life: the upward impetus, the push to grow and expand, the will to renew and flower and bloom. 

The facet of Shen pertaining to Wood is **hun**, the diametrical opposite of **po**, relating to:

- Imagination, creativity, aesthetic and artistic sense (provence of the Artist)
- Intuition and clairvoyance (provence of the Seer/Crank)
- Ability to dream, to future-project, to hope (provence of the Dreamer)
- ability to make and commit to projects, to connect with and relate to the outside world successfully (provence of the Enterpreneur/Socialite/Neuro-Linguistic-Programmer/Successful Person)

The qualities of Wood are very present in our society, but transposed away from the experience of the common individual, and instead collectively shunted into the provence of select individuals and circumstances. The Scientist and the Technologist are some of the most prominent modern figures that ride the wave of push-to-expansion and allow the rest of the populace to participate in it by proxy, through fetishization of said figures and their accomplishments. Very few of 'the common people' allow themselves to dream, to express themselves artistically, to create, to realize their deep desires; such ventures are instead left to the Eccentrics.

Wood is connected to the emotion of choler, which is the energy within us that allows us to overcome/destroy obstacles in our way, of which one possible expression is anger; and what do you know, one word that most commonly follows "anger" is "management." Collectively, we do not regularly use this energy for personal gain and growth, but instead regulate and suppress it. The only socially acceptable expressions of choler allowed to people are in enclosed ritualistic environments, such as [competitive sports](philosophy/2020-11-08-competition.md).

Nowhere better we can observe Western man's very troubled relationship with Nature (Wood) than in farming, which the one context in which Man is forced to work with Nature; but this is done by first destroying Nature, and then rebuilding it in Man's image, to the exacting idea of Man's design, optimally arranged and precisely fed for the purpose of maximum exploitation, done at the hands of iron machines. Nature is not trusted in the least through this process, much less collaborated with, but is instead **dominated**. 

Æther is the more spiritual of the 5 Western elements, and much like the Chinese Wood, it pertains the domain of connectedness to what surrounds us; in Western key, it is intended as the spiritual oneneness and connection to all, but it is very interesting to note that one main road to achieve this sense of relatedness and connectedness is actually to connect back to Nature, to our roots as beings which are integral part of the ecosystem Earth.  
In the same way Æther is a distant fifth in the elements' relevance to Western life, our collective connection to Nature is very tenuous and distorted, and lived with a dulled, deep unconsciousness.

It is also interesting to note that the East-West culture dichotomy is also reflected in the relationship between Metal and Wood, since Metal is associated with cardinal West, and Wood with cardinal East.

The difference in how we manage our Metal and Wood elements also reflects in the way we treat their organs, respectively the lungs and the liver. That is, there's plenty of bad shit happening for both, but what is dangerous to lungs is the focus of a lot more awareness than what is bad for our liver. For example, air quality is considered important and is regularly monitored in cities, while the poisons that we regularly ingest with treated, processed, or downright artificial food is a much laxer affair, leaving our liver to suffer in silence its work of toxin processing. Why is it that we have the dangerous effects of smoking put on very clear display, but there's no such labels on alcohol, with its comparably destructive effects on our livers (to say nothing of the rest of the body system)?  

There's also to note the unrecognized property of chocolate of acting as efficient anger regulator (through acting on the liver), which really speaks to its widespread use in Western society.

All this contributes to diagnose Western culture as extremely Metal-heavy, inevitably creating a profound imbalance in all its tidings. Particularly interesting is that Metal is a nascent Yin element, which encapsulates the process of decomposition, and it's striking just how much this figures in society, like the general concept of decadence, and the widespread practice of "leaving people to rot" in places such as hospices, prisons, and hospitals. Or even our general attitude towards life as being a rush towards death.
