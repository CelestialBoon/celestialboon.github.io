- Interactions with the Universe (both in details and the macro, ie prayer, asking, letter, Universe and SI, basically requesting or communicating with something At Large)
  If you hold the thought of me, imbue it with the expression of your purest Love and your thought will be mine in that moment.
  Speak with me in the same manner, aware that the spiritual content is the medium of your communique.
Basically that introduction to the Universe? the aether? well more like, well really go force and enhance your listening plsss
Connectedness with All of Life for I am this, and this alone (really it all starts to kind of, take form as different aspects of the same being? of the One Entity? like, yep all our world is One, the One entity just with many diffrenet viewpoints)
the One Entity, and basically it's all ways to eventually reach this state of communication and instant feedback. All the rest is opening up to it. Discovering soul, praying to the Universe, feedback from the universe, and gratitude, and the other Life Principles of the SI, it all culminates in tightening the loop (listening, trust, cocreation. The Quantum Perspectives of the Soul)
so basically detailing the various ways of opening up communication/feedback, not only instrument/universe, but also soul/universe
prayer
letter
asking
surrender
synchronicities
putting you through the situations in order for you to learn the lessons
the Quantum Perspectives of Soul
Life Principles of the SI? well, relationship through Gratitude
