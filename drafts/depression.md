depression
because your body just feels bad

and ADHD
because your reward center is on the fritz

and psychopathy
because you're cut off from your emotions for whatever reason

basicallys screwed up base one way or another

and what one needs to realize is that they are off-base,

what usually happens is the brain assumes a working base and works from there, using it as scale against which to measure the moment


just because you feel bad while something is happening doesn't mean it's a bad thing, or that you're doing it wrong.
just because you feel restless, or feel like doing something else, doesn't mean that you're doing it poorly now, or that the next thing you do will actually bring you that chemical reward the brain seeks.
just because you don't feel the emotions taht are happening doesn't mean you're heartless or cruel.

mindfulness is crucial to all three, or rather, mindlessness. Being out of the mind so that it can be properly observed.
You see that the bad is happening and now you know it's a base condition, and not property of the moment itself. You can keep that in mind as reason not to continue that train of thought. From this realization, you can accept the way you are, that it's just an off-base kind of thing.

We are adaptive and resilient, but we have to learn what our reality is about before we stand to truly operate in it, if not change it intentionally.

so whenever you get to those thoughts, you can acknowledge that they come from a misperceived perception of reality. You can realize that you are wearing rose-tinted glasses and if everything looks rose, it's because of those glasses. SO you can remind yourself tnat all is not really rose; that some things may be actually rose, but others are really not as much as they appear, and you can tell; you can recalibrate yourself in the moment based on this base realization of your reality.

This can make it more difficult to navigate realiity, but 

as far as I know, it is possible to escape all three, at least in some cases. 

the elements are given you but you choose the ratios. Among what you have, you choose what gets preponderance, what you bring to the forefront of your consciousness, what you put at your center.
