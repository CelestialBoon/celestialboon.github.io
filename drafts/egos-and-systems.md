this whole, ego loop as illusion,
and what it means for sysstems, and
like, later it grows into something independend? into a soul-hsot??
but until then it's like, this soup of just existence?\
gotta refine it into a proper soul-calling? or so?? wow tat gets like, what?

individuated consciousnesses, the dropping of barriers
the fractality of self.
