time as inseparable from space
motion is the basis of everything
because we're all waves and waves are motion
and nothing is ever static, panta rei
and time has no meaning without something that happens in it, and so is space without something that occupies it 

space time motion
both space and time depend on motion, and motion needs a time and space to exist, so they are inseparable

the way a lot of terms are used both for time and space
such as ahead, long, before

speed is what translates time into space and viceversa, like turning earlier means being in a different space, or how a distance becomes a time of travel
