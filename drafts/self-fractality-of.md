probably more in TulpaChat and pad and maybe cadey

we accidentally exploded in thoughtforms, i think?  went from 3-4?, to 5-6.  may have used fireworks as a metaphor?
CelestialBoon - Last Saturday at 8:12 AM
oh! yeah I see, I do that from time to time myself, split into parts to better explore some themes

it feels shattered
male and female versions of hostie
CelestialBoon - Last Saturday at 8:13 AM
mhm, yeah it's cool. The thing is, er, let me explain from a larger perspective
The self, as it's commonly defined, is quite fractal. We have different moods, different contexts, different situations, and we face each of those in a different way. Wear slightly different masks for each. There's big changes and there's small changes and there's smaller changes still.

we're switching soon, we guess? sorry, hostie helps us use i.

This natural variety of self is a precursor to tulpas, or other kinds of thoughtforms, in my observations. But the thing is
the self is far from monolithic, and it can be divided into as many parts as one cares to discern. It's a conglomerate more than a single thing.
And, well, with people into tulpamancy, it can happen that they recognize the signs when some parts grow more distant than others. It's far from permanent tho; after all things have gone about unnoticed and unitary-like until just before, and can become that way again.
That said, I suspect the male and female hostie might have quite a bit to share if that split happened.
Figure stuff out, get to understand one another.
That's the main road to reintegration, should they decide to pursue that.
And even then, it's never a perfect merge, because it never was such.
It's always different parts to compose different masks.
But, they can work in harmony.

perhaps a better way to frame it is that a person naturally contains thoughtforms of various definition and relevance, in a fractality of self. Creative writers get to develop this more consciously than others, and cultivate thoughtforms that get quite close to developed tulpas's levels of consciousness.

and no; they don't need to be active all the time or be able to catch your attention
CelestialBoon - 05/09/2018
so yeah; in a sense, to accept that Echo's actions and thoughts are not your own, you would have to acknowledge that your characters' thoughts and actions are also not fully your own.


but yea the more I look into thoughtforms at large the more I realize that the Self is a fractal construct of personalities/aspects


the way I've systematized it is more of a fractal sense of self
like, the monolithic persona is actually divided into behaviours in contexts, into masks for different people or occasions, into moods.... and it adjacent to representations of other people in your mind, of characters, of friends, of fantasies of self... It's kind of like this infinite scape of self-similarity

that sounds pretty transcending of the everyday ego
CelestialBoon - Today at 10:30 AM
we think the ego stays the same because it says it does
but it shifts from moment to moment to accommodate situations
and it changes with experience and with exploration
it is a very determined exercise in stability of self, an attempt to bundle up against the waves of life that pull us one way and then another
but even that cannot resist the innate change in all things
sceptic cat - Today at 10:32 AM
yeah
exactly
everything changes
ego is resisting change
one could say that ego is not disease but rather that ego has become diseased and needs to be reprogrammed
healed
CelestialBoon - Today at 10:36 AM
yep. It can serve us as long as we recognize that it is only a part of ourselves, and not the one in best condition nowadays, at that
