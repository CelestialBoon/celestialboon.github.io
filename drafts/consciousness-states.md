life as pursuit of the states of consciousness
the supreme importance of the NOw and the cultivation of our state in the now
and if you're happy in the moment, you're happy in the moment

and the gratitude journal
and the integration
and this different state, which is really all that matters
and how this focus starts to make things make sense
like how we cultivate our bodies to make us feel good
or the regrets is the things that we have kept inside and the things we wanted to do that we didn't, or the talking with friends, the integrations and the reintegrations
and the accumulation, the connections, the synthsesis model, the escathon, this whole increasing of connectivity, this drive at the base of mankind, the pursuit of unity, this thing that is super felt
the shadow of the escathon and this drive tha tis felt, this impulse, this direction, this attractor
aggregation, synthesis, coming together, congregation, we consciousness

and what drives us deep inside and the things that we can surrender to should we choose to, and the whole opening up to the inner world, and the connectiong between it and reality throuth imagination

this whole pursuit of state of consciousness that has been distorted by society in general

also kaizen probably

I found it is mostly about an attachment to the default state of consciousness.
Other things are perceivable, and even thinkable, in other states; but for one, I for a long time have tried to just bring those back into the default state of consciousness once encountered, while that's not how it works at all.
To truly let go is to also accept the possible shift in state of consciousness. Like, you know how some people get scared when they start feeling the vibrations during an OOBE attempt? It's that kind of thing.
It would a bit like trying to visit new places from home. To truly visit them, the original place must be left first.
