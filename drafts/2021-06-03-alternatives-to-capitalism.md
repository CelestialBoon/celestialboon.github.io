watcched bdobbinsftw guy and he's just excellent, masterpieces in there, very well-researched. He's also one of the most unironic "gamers rise up" proponents, which I love, which is very well-argued for, 

narcisisstic phase of the Age of Pisces that is giving way to the Age of Aquarius thinking, the terminal phase of the Piscean zeitgeist is the cocooning typical of narcisisstic acute behaviour
it's like watching a building implode in slow motion, that james quote

> The idea that the higher consciousness can direct our behaviors by synchronizing the body, heart and mind as a team of expression can seem irrelevant in a world that wants easy power, control, money and fame.
> However, this social program is in the process of destruction. Imagine a large building that is being demolished with explosives, and you were able to watch its implosion one frame per day. Every other part of your life was in normal time, but the social program from which you were nourished was being demolished in ultra-slow motion—almost to the point you didn’t notice.

long prophesized collapse of capitalism
the ship is sinking and the solution is to exit it before it takes you with it

dying throes of a system that is trying its hardest to keep you committed to it even if it's doing its barest minimum to keep people in need alive, and it's showing, and more and more are awakening to this fact

the school system is a failure and teaches people nothing of importance. The capitalist system of economics and work is a failure and it leaves most of everyone fully dissatisfied with what they do in life, which is often what they *have* to do to just survive, never mind those who are arbitrarily deemed unfit and are pushed out of the system.

it's gonna be a long, drawn-out agony that will squeeze the bottom increasingly and leave less and less people comfortable, until the system fades purely by being used by someone else, it takes you changing paradigm, there's always a dildo open at the capitalism fuckery


the system has long being rigged in favor of the people with more money, for p > g
it is a system that feeds on your participation as both a consumer and an employee, for every hour of employee work means wealth is being actively funneled to the people who are already rich (most of your plusvalue)
and everything you buy from big companies fulfills the other half of the equation
and now it's time to rise up, gamers, and found something for yourself that does not depend on giving the rich the plusvalue of your work. But communism did not work for doing so. Instead,

communes work
co-ops work
ecovillages work

the point is to create a new economy, a new culture, a new community; to have a radical break from the active insanity of Western faire, and instead live in a system where the value you produce is not taken from you, but is instead free for you to distribute among a community of peers
It's time to break away from a system that starves you of key human necessities (our need for validation, for community, for meaning, for self-expression) and then sells counterfeit scraps of them to you, robbing you in the process, trying to fool you that if you get a bigger car you'll have the validation you crave from your peers; fooling you by trying to pass a slave cattel that is employee work for not just community, but family; fooling you in tying the meaning of your life to your productivity and your participation in a disastrous economic system of malaised capitalism that only makes the rich richer and the poor poorer; fooling you in thinking that buying and displaying some cool shit that others made will satisfy your innate need for self-expression.



it's time to gain as much independence as possible from the big companies concerning all the needs in life, from eating to clothing to beauty and cleaning and health products. It's time for the ecologic, self-production revival. It's time to break away from capitalism as much as possible, from letting someone else own the plusvalue of our work.

Does that mean more work for people? Yeah, absolutely. But we're facing mass unemployment and it's only getting worse from here, and people need (meaningful and self-directed!) work to feel realized, so it's not like we don't have both the need and the means.

> The next three generations will decentralize economies, educational processes, wealth, and even government. Hyper-local, decentralized, but globally connected communities will prosper, and these will be the building blocks to a new social order based largely on egalitarian meritocracy.

It's time to move away from this madness and come back to a closer relationship with what really nurtures, houses and sustains us, the Earth, which is more our Mother than any biological parent could ever be.

for all to partake in the natural wealth that is not really property of anyone, but is instead generously provided by Nature and by Mother Earth. Indigenous Americans said that the land doesn't belong to them; instead, it is they who belonged to the land.

Pagan revival is afoot, not in his image blah blah
live close to the land, close to nature, closer to our innate spirituality, closer to our innate self, and to our innate potentials that our culture has tried its damnedest to strip away from ourselves: our divine imagination, and our divine love.

This shift from the Piscean age is a shift from narcisisstic self-absorption to network and connectedness, from hierarchy to horizontal sharing, from belief to knowledge
