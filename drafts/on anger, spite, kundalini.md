on anger, spite, kundalini

anger is the same creative energy
wood, nature of CTM, the energy of life, sprouting through concrete, the energy to overcome obstacles

hydraulics to understand it, it's a constant stream but can build up a lot of pressure if contained, gradually
and when let go it's again a constant stream
and it's the same creative energy of kundalini, it's that energy that makes us wanna change things
also the same energy as compassion, rage, anger, spite, just that want to do something, to smash something, to make changes in the world, it's all nature, it's all kundalini
terry pratchet was driven by a holy anger towards the world, which he channeled masterfully into nearly a hundred books, and each one filled with scathing and masterfully poignant humour

and it can be sequestered away by hate, and it has to be reclaimed through that hate

and it can be contained at great cost, which is what causes depression (which is repression of our own energy)

for some people it gets spent with a ceaseless train of rolling thoughts 

and there's people who do what they want purely out of spite, and I say that they're doing it right. They're putting their energy that comes from something they don't want into something that they do want, and that's just exactly how it's done
riding spite is a fine, sharp edge, so it's important to keep the balance, but spite allows a very convenient point of focus

applied procrastination is another of those mechanisms, taking the anger for having to do something that we don't want, and putting it into doing something else that we want more
