emotional fight
I'm gonna spend a few words on this, since it's quite the involved topic. I use the metaphor of physical fighting a lot to decipher aggressive social interaction and the resulting emotional adventure since it works out well enough. 
In particular, a number of points carry well enough, such as, you can't just pretend you weren't hit once you did. Shrugging off a hit doesn't undo the damage; it needs to be acknowledged and actions have to come from that awareness.


Since everything is connected, it's often a worthwile investment to see if you can take lessons from one field of experience and transpose it, through metaphor, into another.

If those metaphors are especially load-bearing, they are usually called models.

and one such model is the social interaction on the emotional level through the lens of physical interaction

there is plenty of kinds of [physical/emotional] interaction: gentle, tentative, formal, informal, forceful, violent, and any amount of points on the spectrum and combinations thereof.

all kinds of beautiful stuff can be made in this space, beauty, grace, love, awesomeness, it can leave one feeling very good
however I'd like to focus on the more dangerous part for this article

some people are more delicate than others; some people are less skilled/trained than others to interact on such a field; some people are incapacitated or wounded enough to make a lot of said interactions clumsy, more painful than they have to be, or outright impossible.
on so many levels, some people's sensitivities is better, some people are more capable than others, for skill or experience or just innate differences; and the same blows can be handled and felt in very different ways from different people.

any interaction above the most casual of tones can leave something feeling hurt, for one reason or another; it's a dance in which both your being and the other's are important and it's their interaction, not any one of the singular bodies, that determines what really happens in there.

Of course it's a not-completely-unambiguous landscape: some blows are not meant to hurt, but they do for some reason; others can be meant to injure but be completely shrugged off or they can miss the point entirely.

One part that merits a lot of attention is the more violent end of the spectrum, where progressively less punches are pulled. It's a space where most people have been involved in, and basically everyone has witnessed. It's the space where it becomes a sincere concern to deal with damage and the possibility thereof.
Friendly sparring can stop short of the third one, but 

it is occasionally worthwile to engage in the more dangerous end! strain and effort causes resilience, experience which can grow into skill and possibly develop into mastery. Taken in the right doses and settings, it can be more or less painful, but it's a very fertile ground for personal growth.


There's three main ways of dealing with damage: the first is not getting hit in the first place. Avoiding bad places and situations altogether is one way to do this, but another is just plain dodging. (The emotional equivalent is not as concisely described, but it is the manuevers that culminate in neutral non-reaction).

Not all attacks can be dodged, though, and so the second barrier of defense is rolling with the punches. Resisting instead of just going with the flow, being stiff in the face of opposition, leads what cannot bend to break instead. For most hits, just taking it with flexibility and with the accomodation of water helps mitigate any damage. Remember that it's not just the punch, but the way you receive (react to) it! [EXAMPLES GO HERE]

Some attacks are however too massive for *just* softening the blow, and so at this point damage is inevitable. When you are wounded as such, while you *can* grit your teeth and press on, the wound should be acknowledged, and depending on its gravity, taken into account, since it limits further options and mobility (your emotional range can significantly narrow for the worse)

----

Force can be used in self-defence, in defence of others, or just to demolish someone. Force is force and its uses are many and varied, and its possibilities for evil do not diminish its potential for good.

Remember that it's not a war! Many arts can just deal with a number of facets of aggression in an elegant, graceful and effective way.
A number of those are focused on using [the force of the attacker against themselves / the principle of projection: that at some level, a person is always talking about themselves,] and use that to neutralize them instead of bringing equal opposite force (eg. counterarguments) against it, which can become quite messier. Taken with the right approach, much of it can be as much dance and play.

In case something bad happened, aftercare can already do miracles and treat injuries right when it's easiest to, before anything nastier develops.

For at least most people, the baseline is happy healthy living. Anything less signals something is off somewhere. There can be external pressure, ambient damage, but in destressed conditions, one would ideally reach that point.
health is the quiet joy at rest. Some push it to feel that good and give a kind of ecstasy to every event they face.

Remember that some wounds have a lot more bark than bite and have little consequences for the big initial pain, while some can barely register in the moment but have disastrous consequences on the longer term if unattended.

Many open or tender wounds can shoot up pain at the slightest provocation, which makes them very difficult to ignore, and if not healed, one's behaviour warps around them so to avoid further provocation and the consequent pain, sometimes reaching heights of avoidance to verge into forgetful denial

Don't forget that self-injuring is very very possible! It's especially easy to just handle existing wounds without the proper care and open them again, sometimes making things worse in the process. Poorly-healed wounds can become a constant concern that ends up limiting one's [mobility/possibilities] and in general all sorts of nasty pathologies can develop around them to just cope with the suboptimal situation.

for the real bad stuff, intervention to re-set condition could be necessary, like [setting bones/realizing where the trauma lies and properly gaining awareness on the condition], or to prevent further damage like [disinfecting wounds/managing the reaction to triggers], or even to speed up the healing like [using healing balms/creating experiences that strongly contradict the trauma]. Sometimes only some of those are required; sometimes all three, in different variations.

Healing is a complicated and vast scape, but with one constant: for all the good the softer interactions can do, especially if purposefully guided, it remains that the true healing always comes from inside: it is always the body that ultimately heals itself. What comes from the outside can only facilitate the process. 

THE DIFFERENCES

The recovering from deep wounds is the part where the metaphor breaks down the most; if it is because of the state of modern medicine or it is innate to the two fields, that is irrelevant to the model.

It remains though that physical injuries are more often than not treated on the spot if they're bad enough to warrant it, while the same cannot be said for emotional wounds.
Inversely, a lot of the "recent" developments in psychology are about how to escape the chronic conditions such as depression, anxiety, PTSD etc. caused by accumulation of trauma that is not immediately addressed, while there is relatively little focus on handling old scars and chronic physical disabilities except by means of pain management and stabilization of vitals (which are paralleled by antipsychotics, antidepressants, and the like on the other side. Just palliatives to mask the symptoms, which is of course still useful, but is not true healing; it is not really curing the condition, it's merely medicating it). The working model is gradually shifting away from the "chemical imbalances in the brain" bullshit to something that more resembles the patient as an organism that has all the tools to heal itself, much like a seed contains the tree, if only the right conditions are provided.

Naturally, there's plenty more guides, schools of thought, and overall circulating wisdom on how to handle oneself physically than emotionally. Many are just left clueless about what emotions *are*, much less how one can live with them in a sane, synergistic manner.

Emotional handling and emotional development are a more conscious affair than physical development, which is handed subconsciously for the most part. This is part of the reason why emotional maturity is severely lagging behind physical maturity for many, since it's not an automatic process and many do not have the faintest idea of where the up and down are in this scape, much less how to navigate it effectively.

This is compounded by the fact that it's a lot easier to become numb to emotions (apathy?) than become numb to physical pain, or even to just not map body feelings to emotional understanding (called alexithymia: "What does this chest tightness mean? Who knows!"), so to severely hinder the hopes of figuring out what's going on under the surface (both can be reversed though! It's happened for many)

Remember that just because you can't feel it doesn't mean it's not there! The unconscious is a vast and very lively place where a lot of your functions take place, including the cognitive ones. Just because no emotions are felt in the process doesn't necessarily mean none are involved,
