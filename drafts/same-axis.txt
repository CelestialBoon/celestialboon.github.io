humor and violence are on the same axis, just as light and dark, they're very related concepts
like violence is making unto things (and that's where sin is), humor is also putting attention on something and spinning it in some way
and crying is on the same axis as laughing
cry-laughing, or laughing so much that you cry

anger and creativity
pain and pleasure!

but also: fear, wonder, curiosity, desire, excitement, love

arousal and shame! which is why the probhibited fruit

really, just look at the chinese elements
water - fear and curiosity
metal - sadness
earth - 
fire - 
nature - anger and creativity

anxiety - excitement
