So people sometimes say "We are what we eat." It feels true, but not THAT much, right? Doesn't it all get broken down into nutrients anyway? Don't we just need the right nutrient sludge to sustain the body? Nope! Nutrition is much more than keeping the body fed.

Nutrition also severely impacts your gut flora, which aside from aiding digestion (and leading to digestive issues if unbalanced), it has far-reaching influence going much beyond simple digestion. For example, there's a whole brain right next to it!

The enteric nervous systems counts enough neurons to equip a small mammal, is home to the gut feelings, and is closely tied to the gut flora, which is responsible for ~90% of the body's serotonin production! A healthy gut is key to a functional brain.

Hippocrates said that all disease begins in the gut, and while simplistic, this is a valuable piece of wisdom: the gut flora can provide valuable chemicals, or fill the body with toxins, causing inflammation and a host of other possible ailments.

For example, a poor gut ecosystem has been correlated with substantial worsening of autism symptoms (including an improvement once the gut flora is rebalanced). The intestinal flora plays an undeniable part in the body's chemistry and neural function.

Could Treating Gut Bacteria Help Autism Symptoms?
All the children in the study had severe digestive issues, so once they were more comfortable perhaps they were better able to focus and learn. Healthier microorganisms in the gut also may send...

You know the story of the two wolves inside you? This plays out on a very material level: depending on what you ingest, some gut bacteria will thrive compared to others, with repercussions for the whole body. Diet is not just for the body, but for the whole ecosystem within you.

For example processed carbs (sugar, white bread, pasta etc.) & some artificial sweeteners feed the bad kind of gut bacteria (eg. Clostridium, Enterobacteriaceae), while fibers, resistant starch, whole grains, polyphenols etc. feed the good kind (eg. Bifidobacteria, lactobacilli)

Probiotics are definitely also an excellent choice, such as yogurt and fermented foods, precisely for the reason that they are prepared exactly so to develop cultures of the good kind of bacteria, while the food listed before were prEbiotics, which just feed said bacteria.

Not to mention that the different kinds of gut ecosystem can also influence your eating tastes and habits! Both kinds of gut ecosystem (healthy, unhealthy) are self-sustaining, which means that they are likely to shape one's cravings, possibly directly via gut brain.

Which means that once the gut ecosystem shifts, one might observe a change in one's cravings (like eg. a reduced need to eat bread) and diet choices/willingness.

There's plenty of material out there to further inform on the situation, which is a vital component of health.
