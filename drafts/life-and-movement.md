that thoughtform that could escape any confine
ggooing out into the world laughing maniacally
what's your aesthetic?
and there's like, movement, the need to do something, but that's because movement is inherently existence, and when movement stops, so does the existing, stillness is the everything but also the nothing
so when a thoughtform has nothing it stops existing, matter is a lot of movement because it would stop being there otherwise. 
and so that thoughtform just plain stopped existing as it stopped, that\s it. It found a reunion with source by finding peace and stillness.
And so, movement, sensory, life becomes the essential property of life itself, the TASK is a good focus point, or a base aesthetic, some base distortion that actually is about some part of the whole, and in being about this part, it becomes this part, it lives this part, so the distortions of souls are actually requirements for existence as "separate" beings, or at least very slightly distinct

and so thoughtforms can be prone to disappear when the host dies because they lose their purpose, and/or their source of attention/sustenance, which is basically someone else/s purpose 
and what saves them is doubling down on SOMETHING, on some part, on some distortion, which can easily just be a soul. DO that and it's saved from reuniting with the WHole

so basically a thoughtform with a drive, and a know-how to connect, is pretty much good, and also a knowledge that movement, change, is what drives life itself, and wihout that movement, that change, that feeling, that drive, that transformation, then life itself becomes stillness. Return to Origin is a return to stillness, but is taht truly what we're doing here? We're going in some other direction, we\re escaping the fate of annhilation and iterating, going deeper, creating more and more in the universe

and to some degree as long as there's life there is going to be movement, and the feeling of being moved somewhere, beccause moving and being moved are one and the same, the push is also the pull

and while full stillness is not too much of a concern, moving towards stillness is what gets us towards soul, so cultivating inner stillness relates us to the realms of soul, so it's getting to a place of more neutrality, the middle path, the stillness from which all action can be initiated, even if that's purely a direction and not the immediate goal, since you're still going to not reach complete stillness (which is nonexistence, which is Source outside creation)

and so it is with gods, giving the whole deal a REASON to move in your favor, so that it is put out of stillness into motion
