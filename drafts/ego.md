# The Ego

the  way I define ego is the thought loop that is self-affirming, as in saying, this is me, this is who I am
you can go without ego but it kinda feels like using a computer without a fundamental program that you always use


ego as thought loop that is self-sustaining
the thinker of the thoughts is just another thoughts
and the feeler of the feelings is just another feeling

and the tension of the mind
and this fixation, caused by the belief that we are the mind, so of course the mind identifies with a product of itself

bra

Nirvana is the ego death. The condition in which there is no thought loop that is self-identifying. In which there is simple, being.

ego as looping thought stream
sense of stability, feedback loop
sense of identity
nirvana
ego death and stages thereof
the atom prevents it
gradient
not identifying as the ego
but somewhere else (I AM WE ARE? or at least soul I guess)
the individuated consciousness


There are four stages of ego death. The first is basic confusion and lack of focus. The second is a near total collapse of short-term memory. The third is when the long-term memory begins to fail which is the beginning of the fragmentation of the self. The person may be unable to recall loved ones, details of themselves and even language. The fourth and highest level is where it all really kicks off though with complete loss of both short and long-term memory. Basically, your ego vanishes and therefore so do you.


The all powerful being is the demiurge. The secret order is awakened and aware people, and a great majority of gods out there. The orherwordly entities from my experience with lovecraftian and alien gods who "supposedly" work with fear. For me, since I fear none. I actively combat it daily with sexual energy, and my will/strength to make friends and love with it. Isn't true. I see them as no different then the previous generation of gods. However, I disagree about the ego death. As long as we are in flesh, we cannot kill the ego. The trick is the mind. The mind is the workaround, to do the things you spoke of doing without it. The consciousness  people speak of I believe to be the universe rebirths, the one I've seen, and there are many, is Oblivion. One cannot feel empowered from without. It comes from within. People will die yes. But it's but a illusion, the outcome beautiful. All live.  The fight is called Ragnarok. Reality I consider to be subjective per Individual. I believe the fight the struggle to kill the demiurge isn't in the order you spoke of. But of the order guiding those blinded by illusion (dogma) to defeat there own enslaver. One being no matter how powerful cannot defend itself from its very existence and the energies it's built upon shattering down beneath and around it. By millions of people, it fed on, and comprises in its aspects.
I believe the multi dimensional theory to be this, the universe isn't one dimension one plane. It was in the beginning, and in it's ends.  It was walled off by itself, to create separate dimensions.
If one sees the truth, he best have  a strong mind to handle it. Because all truths contain grimly details, and great strides.

"As long as we are in flesh, we cannot kill the ego" - I agree with this personally, especially since Kali said to me "The atom prevents you from trying to remove it"
I'll read the rest later my friend! thank you for sharing
really good stuff to look into

ForTheWynneOnReddit: um, define awaken and separate here

and, as always, keeping up group metta and Quantum Pauses. It really pays off! It makes it a whole lot easier to carry that aware, loving, light meditative state into the daily life.

It gets clearer and clearer that I'm working by subtraction here. Removing the densities that distracted, separated me from this innate state, rather than making any specific effort to reach it in particular. It's something that one just has by default, and there's little to do but remove the things in the way.

Yeah ebbs and flows are a thing of life. Again, the core point of so many teachings that reach for enlightenment is that the struggling is part of the problem.

The ego that keeps trying, trying, trying, is turbulence that is not the still mind. Tension that is not the simple stillness that sits at the heart of us.

It takes a bit of a shift in perspective that we are not our ego, our personality, we are not any observer that sits in our minds any more than there's someone inside a tape recorder when that tape recorder would spout a phrase talking about that tape recorder

just because the mind is capable of self-reflection it doesn't mean that it has to base its identity on that self-reflection

any more than a robotic arm that can grasp itself should.

it is difficult to imagine in the common materialistic westerner perspective, but there is something behind the thoughts. There is a base awareness, a still consciousness, and the point is that we are that consciousness. And any struggle of the thoughts to do something or other is just shapes on a screen in front of that consciousness. They are not the self.

and that's why the point of meditation is to still the thoughts so that we can experience what's behind it. The point of confusion is where people think the responsibility sits in doing that.

the ego can't remove thoughts because the ego itself is a thought. Only by not doing any of that do the thoughts stop, at least eventually.

and more than that, the point is to realize that there is no point to the struggle because there is no one struggling. Again, there's no real ego, only a pretense of such. A shape of a thing on a screen that is not that thing.

And when one realizes THAT one, well that's basically the biggest part of enlightenment.

btw I absolutely, completely recommend hearing all this from someone way more fluent in this than me, that is Alan Watts https://www.mediafire.com/folder/kw893gvu2n0qk/Alan_Watts_-Various_Lectures
