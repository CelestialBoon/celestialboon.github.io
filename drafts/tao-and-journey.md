"The Tao gives birth to One.
One gives birth to Two.
Two gives birth to Three.
Three gives birth to all things."

In the beginning, there was Nothing. In one of the greatest mysteries, the Nothing gave birth to Motion, the One.

Heraclitus said that all flows (panta rei) because all *is* flow; it is pure motion. The verb without subject or object.

From motion, the concepts of origin (yin) and destination (yang). The two poles of *direction*.

From direction, the concept of the Journey. That which is made of motion but that sublimates it into Life.

From Journey/Life, all other things arise.
