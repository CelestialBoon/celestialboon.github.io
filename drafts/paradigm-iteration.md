the intent
the paradigm
the RESONANCE
the openness to certain things and not others, that shapes our world
our state of consciousness, effectively

the very thing we see
to change your life, change your mind - Jim Diamond
"The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new lands but seeing with new eyes." - Marcel Proust

the place from where you observe things change how they appear
and there's a feedback loop
letting the universe reconfigure itself around you

what you can bring back from the psychedelic experience
what you can fit into your understanding, what structure
what lenses
what vibration, what frequency can you pick up

and also what you explore

feerback loop of exploraiton

always something more, better, different, new
perfect imperfection
ignorance that begets new knowledge
foolishness that begets new wisdom

collect experiences and distill wisdom

that whole, got lessons but had to relearn them for Love since DCTC

asking the two questions
shaping and iterating
a million times, chiseled into a statue of transformation
