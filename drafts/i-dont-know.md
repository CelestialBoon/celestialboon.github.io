# IDK

## so what is a density anyway?

it's a past wound
energy imprisoned within the body
engrams
the suppressed emotions
the past traumas
and they come out in a number of forms
from fears to intrusive thoughts to disturbances and blockages in our energy body, all sorts of mental scars, up to PTSD and above

they're what therapy is supposed to cure, they're the obstacles in the way of enlightenment, and all sorts of deals, and what all those new age sites are telling you to shed so that you can embrace the New Vibrations

## baseline of awareness

which means that the more conscious and aware you are of what goes on, the better. This especially includes your thoughts and emotions, and your ability to keep your relaxed attention on them. The ability to consciously redirect your relaxed attention is especially trained in meditation, in pretty much any form, to the point that this kind of open attention is called either mindfulness, or meditative focus.
Being aware of your thoughts and feelings, and being able to observe them without jumping to a reaction to them, is very useful here, and allows to direct the experience with few detours.

### neutrality why: 

see below, THE RIDE
so there's the two parts 
	the IDK
	the pain body stuff from Tolle
	the whole identification/reaction thing
	or also neutrality of the mind
	the absence of reply etc.
	to understand why, see below


### neutrality how: 

just observe without judgment, say IDK, come from the heart, have plans for them (like cuddle sessoins) break the cycle

### rewriting why: 

When dealing with densities, it is best to operate at a level of feelings first and foremost (and this includes the emotions that they store), since they are creatures of feelings, and not reason; and they are dealt with through feelings, and not rationality//
because they are things of feelings and not rationality, and they are dealt with feelings and not rationality

### rewriting how: 

manifesting, suffering into consciousness, alchemy

life as vital, intelligent, purposefull, agile, free, creative, undetermined, and eternally supported by Source Intelligence, even the demons

just feeling them, letting them express themselves, get to the core issue, expression, highest epxression, guidance in 
love, sharing love, 
and sharing feelings
the sharing feeleings is like, no judgement, just getting stuff out, to one another, squaring it out
seeking the highest expression of both
and sharing lots of love
so there's basically
	feeling the pain body ala Tolle
	love work ala Quantum Pause
	neutral heart?
	tulpaforcing from the heart

AH so
neutrality: why, how
emotional rewriting: why, how

the three principles of the sovereign integral also apply really really well to the whole thing, so yeah, def something to quote

------
transmutation, alchemy, suffering into consciousness
life is [adjectives]
observance without labeling, so that they can change
feeling without running away and without agreement. Pure perception, without the mind.
The mind can simply say idk, it can NOT KNOW
inner focus, still mind, and equanimity (marks of jhana)
watching things transform inside you, and reveal more, and reveal deeper, and go the depths, and all comes up, and you are immersed, and it becomes you, you are that, and you are also much more, you are all that, it is you
reclaiming of energies, use them for being
awareness of Being, and of teh body, like really, awareness of the energetic body is super good

the main problem stems from the "you shouldn't feel like that"
you are the whole universe, all facets, all properties, all qualities, all being, everything

From timber
cuddle sessions


from faith
jhana memories

from cadey

From V
that manifestation

From  me
release the demons

from Tolle
pain body
observation, alchemy of consciousness

From wm
that life is vital etc.


We forgive because we know to be human is to be limited, and in that limitation we make choices that appear unwise or are flowed. But if we choose unwisely because of our limitations, we also judge unwisely for the very same reason. Thus, we can not judge, and so we forgive.

so this last conversation with Diana really got me thinking
about the things we manifest in our lives, and why
because I've noticed that many things we consider in some way or other negative are echoes of a past we're still keeping inside, in some shape or another, born of experience, beliefs, things told to you, whatever
and so I've been asking myself, why this? why do we let this happen, effectively?
if we really did not want them around, at some level, they would not be, it's that simple. So why?
and I think the truest answer to it is that we are keeping the densities, the intrusive thoughts, the past experiences or beliefs around, because we incessantly try to *make sense* of them, trying to form patterns out of them so that we can use those to figure out our lives from then on
we keep them around in hopes of learning something from them
and we fail to, but we don't give up on the idea, and so we continue
and so a person gains trauma from an interaction with someone once, and from then on is haunted by that density, desperately trying to reconcile that event with the rest of the universe, thinking that it should *make sense*, that there should be a *pattern* to it
thinking that since one was raped and lied to when they were little then one has to watch out for that for the rest of their lives and cannot trust anyone etc.
because that would be the ways of inference
except that it doesn't exactly work like that.
As much as we incessantly try pretend to, and try and conform the world to this vision, we do not live in a world of order and orderly patterns.
Information is the condensing of possibility into probability, but even this fails us as we fail to account for the fundamental changes of reality that each moment brings.
`Every moment there is a universe.`
No single instant is the same as another; the true laws that govern it, if any, are not known to us, and what we can observe is just patterns.
And all of those patterns are just ephemeral observations of stability before the next wave washes it away.
We live at the criticality between chaos and order, where things are built just to be destroyed after, and rebuilt in a new image
all beliefs to be ultimately jettisoned, all information to be updated, all visions to be revised
and amidst all this is the critical misconception that the current mind, the observer of the minute patterns and the limited picture, is supposed to figure it out
so that we keep presenting ourselves with the past in hopes that some time we will *get it* once and for all
while that is purely impossible. In a world of creators, no law that we can observe needs be obeyed.
Nothing is true, so everything is permitted.
And when those intrusive thoughts come back again and again on our call, when the past is recalled painfully, when they present ourselves to us through our asking, however implicit
there's really nothing else to say than, "I don't know." I don't know if what happened is a good or bad thing, in the grand scheme of things. I don't know if what's gonna happen next is going to be the same or different. I don't know the laws that govern any of that, because there really aren't any. We can't figure it out because there's nothing to figure out.
and amidst all this, the ideal way to go about would be actually coming from a place that has the largest angle of vision possible; the place that actually holds the knowledge, the intelligence that allows one to really *know*, even if we can't possibly *know* at the level that the mind demands to know, the level of patterns and structure and separation.
and such a place is indeed, currently, the heart. Or whatever allows us best to receive Source Intelligence, really, so pretty much the heart.
And from there, switching from a paradigm of prediction and pattern-forming to one of pure self-exploration, of experience of the moment as the pure reason for all this. The journey that truly becomes the destination.
and indeed, this is also paralleled in the whole paradigm of Earth as school, as place of lessons, which while having a shard of truth to it, it is fundamentally misdirecting
since this misplaces the focus, the reason of the experience, from having value in itself, as expression of self-creation, to means of learning some enduring lesson or other
which again, is fundamentally misguided

Cadey~Today at 3:33 PM
That is some hell of a thing to consider
CelestialBoonToday at 3:34 PM
yeah, I know right
it's been some time in the making
also I would like to add that indeed, we can clear the densities, dispel the intrusive thoughts, etc.
Cadey~Today at 3:35 PM
Yeah
CelestialBoonToday at 3:35 PM
as soon as we realize that the reason for summoning them is effectively just a frustrating exercise in misplacement of power
that they come to demand an answer from us because *we* asked them to have us give an answer
and as soon as we realize that we don't have to give one, that we can't give one
we can break the cycle

=============

ðŸŒˆFaithðŸŒˆToday at 5:57 AM
D\ Yeah
D\ moreover we integrate these fears and traumas into our identity
D\ to the point where like - you know I've heard people say like they can't forgive someone for a wrong done to them because it would feel to them like it's against their morals to forgive the wrong 
D\ that's how tightly the pain is woven into their self, that they see healing that pain as giving up a piece of their own identity
CelestialBoonToday at 6:00 AM
yep, they fear giving up that pain because they effectively fear losing themselves
and they cannot fathom a self without it

ðŸŒˆFaithðŸŒˆToday at 6:01 AM
D\ and because like you say they're looking for a lesson that may not exist - so giving up the pain feels like giving up this fabricated lesson, and thus makes it feel pointless
D\ and perhaps it is pointless
D\ but the idea of purposeless pain is disturbing

CelestialBoonToday at 6:02 AM
yeah, we insist that things happen for a reason, but what we don't realize is that the reason is not necessarily of the mind

ðŸŒˆFaithðŸŒˆToday at 6:02 AM
D\ and really the lesson is there it's just at a broader scale

CelestialBoonToday at 6:04 AM
yeah

ðŸŒˆFaithðŸŒˆToday at 6:05 AM
D\ you know why the later jhanas have no pleasure in addition to no pain
D\ because memories of pain are painful to relive but memories of pleasure also take us out of the Now and into the Then. Because memories of pleasure make the Now feel lesser

CelestialBoonToday at 6:07 AM
well really, the Now contains innate joy and rapture, there's no need to fish it anywhere in the past

ðŸŒˆFaithðŸŒˆToday at 6:07 AM
D\ precisely
D\ memories of the past and visions of the future distract from the Now
D\ I don't think that's a bad thing - I think there is a place for memories and visions
D\ but when the time comes for the Now, they have no place

CelestialBoonToday at 6:09 AM
I don't think jhanas are about anything but the Now?

ðŸŒˆFaithðŸŒˆToday at 6:09 AM
D\ right
D\ but we can not live within the jhanas
D\ one must return to the car after an excursion outside of it, for the car has a purpose too

CelestialBoonToday at 6:11 AM
You do not need to leave your room. Remain sitting at your table and listen. Do not even listen, simply wait, be quiet, still and solitary. The world will freely offer itself to you to be unmasked, it has no choice, it will roll in ecstasy at your feet. â€• Franz Kafka
You know, I've been wondering about this exact thing lately

ðŸŒˆFaithðŸŒˆToday at 6:13 AM
That quote is very true
That's how well, all of this happened
Everything in my life it seems comes from not even looking for opportunities
But them finding me
And that's really how I live is just I continue and take the opportunities as they present themselves
I don't have to look for them - the important thing is not looking for them, it's paying attention to them after they come after you, rather than ignoring them
That's the choice we make
Which opportunities we pay attention to once they've found us
CelestialBoonToday at 6:17 AM
mhm, so the question was, is it possible that we're actually supposed to live in lasting joy?
and the more I look about it, the more I find that the answer is actually yes
in the sense that deep peace and lasting joy is simply the state soul lives in
and what we're doing is effectively bringing its consciousness here
while it is not pleasure, for yeah pleasure and pain are things of the body, and they cycle etc.
there's still v much the joy to look forward to

ðŸŒˆFaithðŸŒˆToday at 6:18 AM
The joy to be had Now

CelestialBoonToday at 6:18 AM
yep exactly, innate in the moment
-----
Depression is such a weird thing. We keep expecting that things will improve from this or that activity, but no matter how much I did, the baseline low mood just, remained
at the time, I just made peace with the idea that I felt bad just because, that I didn't have to criticize myself for when I felt bad when doing something. It was just how I was doing, and that was that.
since then, well A Lot Of Things happened since then, and I think the most decisive among them has been my ayahuasca journeys, but even then, what that allowed me is opening up to my feelings.
Like, depression most often comes from a place of shutting oneself out from their own body, from their own feelings and emotions. I know I've done it.
It's an all too easy thing to do, and we're given all too many reasons for doing so, personal, interpersonal, transpersonal. There's so much pain around, and we never get taught how to process it, how to transform it into consciousness.
and it's a painful journey, full of the things you've shoved down deep into your recesses of self, but honestly, it's been the way out for me.
CelestialBoonToday at 8:11 PM
until then, depression is just this, constant state of emptiness, of not feeling oneself, and being trapped within the mind because it's the thing that we've left ourselves to listen to.
