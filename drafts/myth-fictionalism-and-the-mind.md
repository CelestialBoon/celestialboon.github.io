# Fictionalism and magic and exploration of self and myth

imagination
taking things
people immersed in medita
obsessing over the media, thinking about the media all the time, taking from it
and still they live a life

really important role of stories in the human life
stories as sythesis
and as metaphors
and as condensation of wisdom

and myth
myth quotes

and the conveying of the real through myth
and the myth quotes

somethoing that they do int he spare time
and it makes them happy
it gives them purpose
it makes them feel important
not all people are destined to make grand discoveries or to face the harsh truths of reality in order to break down some wlal or other
many people just cope with ordinary life
and this is something that enriches them
it's like poeple reading novels
they get immersed and they believe what they read is the real thing for an hour or two, and that's what excites them.
They start to partake in that world, dayrdreaming about it, like if it were real.
But then they put it aside and go to work.
And that's the same here.
Most people do something in the spare time and they get to enjoy doing it and then they just live the rest of their lives.

like playing piano all day and then suddenly the tenant says that you've overdue oon your rent
