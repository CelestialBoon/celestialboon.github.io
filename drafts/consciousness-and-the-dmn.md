you know how it works with the Default Mode Network?
that's basically the mind's attempt at stability, at keeping things going in a relatively stable and controlled manner. The ego is central to it, as illusion of stable self-image
when you exit that is when you start becoming more sensitive to feedback, when you can let yourself be carried away
and that's not something for all times admittedly. There's the set and the setting for that
but when you have those, it's just about letting things spiral out of control

Student: What prevents me from experiencing my innermost self? 
Teacher: Nothing.
Student: Then why don’t I experience it?
Teacher: Fear.
Student: So, then fear prevents me? 
Teacher: Nothing prevents you.
Student: But didn’t you just say that fear is the reason I can’t experience this state of consciousness?
Teacher: Yes, but it does not prevent you.
Student: Then what does?
Teacher: Nothing.

there's the innate push to keep things confined and stable, controlled, within the comfort zone
and then there's nothing else
you open yourself to feedback and then let things go as they will. You set yourself up good, you will go good places
and Cadey's set herself up beyond good here

Yes
