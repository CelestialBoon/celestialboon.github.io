exploration of self through tulpaforcing
the focusing
that subtle distinction from knowing and being told
and the search of understanding in whatever means we can do

that whole part of the tulpaforcing from the heart



tulpamancy understood
   the non-self that is the self
   schizophrrenia
   acting on be because they are the non-self. Acting on me because they are the self.
   Animating presence. Life-giving passive. Radiance of love. (All this time I've been looking for the stuff and it was ME lmao)
   the presence of God
   Alekasa: By your very presence, everything you see is, becomes anymated and alive and conscious and sentient and intelligent. It is by your love that this happens. And it's something deeper than you can fathom. Your whole woorld is alive and well.

   embraced all my tulpas. Parts of self. Fragments around a core.

The soul looking back to itself w/mirror and discovering the need for self-love, to learn self-love, to do self-love
