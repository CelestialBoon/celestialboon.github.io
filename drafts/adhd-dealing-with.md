dealing with ADHD
the video of the guy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Li_tcua0AJI
the quotes of that gal about it, dopamine and such
the soft thinking
the knowing that other things ALSO won't bring the hit and so you're free to do whatever since there's always the same outcome, like, the knowing with certainty that it's a thing about you and not of what you're doing so it's not a deal of looking for something else


comorbidity of ADHD, psychopathy and depression
freed from the shackles of the internal reward system
if I can bring myself to do things despite it, I can bring myself to do anything
how much of a blessing in disguise can it truly be?

bout adhd and stuff
important thing to note: the number one thing in psychiatry (and medicine in general) is that it's not a problem unless it's a problem :p
i.e. if it's not affecting you negatively, it's not a disorder or an illness
at least, not to a degree where it's actually interfering with your life
and second
adhd is very poorly understood by basically everyone lol
people with it can focus, they just have a hard time of choosing when and where to focus
most people can choose to focus on things they need or want to get done, but with adhd that becomes difficult because the adhd brain is basically constantly seeking stimulation
because the adhd brain isn't overstimulated, it's actually understimulated
in essence, the cord of adhd is that the adhd brain has a shortage of dopamine (the "reward" chemical in your brain that makes you feel good), so the brain constantly looks for a source of it
that's why delayed gratification is really goddamn hard for people with adhd
and why they're unable to focus on "boring" or "uninteresting" (read: non-stimulating) things
the flipside is that with adhd, when the brain DOES find something that releases dopamine, it can get stuck doing that same task exclusively, because it's basically finally found a task that can constantly and steadily cause enough of a dopamine reaction that it doesn't need to look for anything else
which is why people with adhd often "hyperfocus" on things they find interesting (read: stimulating), usually to the exclusion of everything else around them
... also why people with adhd often write or talk a LOT if they're talking about something that interests them <.<
I'd recommend reading/watching dr russell barkley if you want to know more
@Alviere yeah but a lot of people still think that adhd is people being overstimulated and that stimulants somehow have the opposite effect on people with adhd
they do actually have the same effects on people with adhd as everyone else, they raise dopamine and/or norepinephrine :P(edited)
no, it doesn't decrease motivation
when you're low on dopamine, your brain tries to seek out sources of stimulation
this is separate from motivation
motivation is basically just wanting to do something, most people don't have many issues with that, and if they do, they either have a reason for not wanting to do it (e.g. anxiety), or they have something messed up going on (e.g. depression)
like, with adhd you can be motivated and want to do something with every goddamn fiber in your being
but it doesn't make it any easier to concentrate and actually do it
which is really frustrating
oh yeah then add depression and you lack motivation to begin with lol
mania is "fun" too
then you get ALL THE MOTIVATION
but can't focus any easier
so you jump back and forth between a lot of "very important" (lol) stuff
sleep deprivation can cause symptoms similar to mania in some people
manic episodes last for a long time though
like weeks to months
but like I said, sleep deprivation can also cause similar symptoms in some people
in fact, sleep deprivation can cause mania in people with bipolar

self-regulation disorder
need more frequent consequences around me than other people in order to perform at the same level
frequency immediacy salience and the timing of consequences, they need more accountability
perseveration is of ADHD
anger, temper, easily annoyed, easily bored, unable to tolerate waiting, more spontaneous showing of emotion, more excitable, irritability (which makes it no surprise I went fucking psychopath to cope)
distractability, forgetfulness, memory problem (HA I fixed my memory problems!)
blindness to the future, will wait until the imminent future
executive failure, preventing organization across time
living in the moment
