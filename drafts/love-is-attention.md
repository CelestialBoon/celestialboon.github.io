Love is attention. 

To love someone is to pay attention to them. To care about them. But notice that there's a very telling etimology hidden behind the word 'care', which has roots in ku-/kav-, which is **observing**. When you take care of something, you start by paying attention to it. It is also the root of the world **cure**, for curing someone is also to take care of them.

Notice how there's this dual quality to the words care/cure? How they have roots in the mere act of paying attention, but they convey an action that resolves some kind of need of the moment. Both of these things is what love does; it is an investment into something or someone, which implies paying a lot of attention, and it also creates/does something from this observation, something that is transformative and that sends things forward.

Giving real love is giving attentive love, love that sees and knows and understands, love that isn't cookie-cutter but is instead deeply personalized, in the same the gift that really matters is the gift that is thoughtful, the gift in which time has been spent to observe and to understand what best to do.

Loving yourself means taking care of yourself, and taking care of yourself means paying attention, real attention, to what goes on, to your needs and your processes and to the relationship with your environment and to all kinds of things

But there are many kinds of love. If you hate something, it's because you care about it, and if you hate something you are paying attention to it. So hate is also a form of love. 

To love someone in a different way is spelled that we see them in a different light. Inevitably this is coupled with a shift in our attention on them, seeing different things that a different light brings to fore

One definition of falling in love is nothing more that lifting the veils of misconception between two entities, and still being able to go forward towards some kind of union. - Terence McKenna

love is a state of consciousness, and attention is paramount too consciouosness, focus is a central part
attention is central to consciousness, and the way we pay attention is the way we love
what we focus on is what we love, one way or another (many layers of love! Many kinds! Many types of consciousness, 11 layers of consciousness)

Attention is a core component of love. You cannot love what you don't pay attention to, and the way you can love something is inextricably connected to the way you pay attention to it. 

Fetish is when the love of the whole is replaced by the love of the part

the divine, ultimate, unconditional love is the one that loves and embraces anything, and is thus unfocused. It is the single most effortless act possible. It is the total release and openness, embracing all that surrounds you and letting it all in in turn, letting yourself be loved by all things.

To let yourself be loved by something, you have to be attention. And to love everything is, in turn, to allow everything to love you in turn.

Kids are unfocused, and in this they express unconditional love; they take it all in 

Though it may take a more mature and alchemically proficient consciousness in order to actually be able to stay that way, to be open to all winds and to dance with them

For it is only when we pay attention to things that they have the ability to change our mind, if we are aware of them on some level, even subconscious

To love everything is the not-focus on anything, it is the release, the letting one take it all in and letting ourselves be loved by all things, letting them all express our love for us, even if sometimes it's weird and fetishistic.

Everything that is paying attention to you is also loving you, at least in some fetishistic way (even someone that just wants your money is appreciating a part of you, the part of you that is the riverbed of the money flow, your capacity for routing power/energy in the form of money)

There is no more unhappy being under the sun than a fetishist who pines for a boot and has to content himself with an entire woman. - Karl Kraus

Fetishism, we would argue, is by definition a displacement of meaning through synecdoche, the displacement of the object of the desire onto something else through processes of disavowal. (Gamman and Makinen 1994: 45)

Disawoval Ã¨ il disconoscere - stop paying attention!

What you resist not only persists, but will grow in size - Carl Jung

gli innamoratelli che non possono smettere di fissare l'oggetto del loro amore
how wounding it is when someone can't bear to look at you


being able to see things for the love they can give, for what they value of you
and in the world of man they are fetishistic, like feet lovers; they value only specific parts of you, like your attention, or your money, or your stomach etc.
houses are built to be dependent on us, always degrading (right angles, square, earth, yin, decomposition), always needing our intervention (not all that man builds needs to be this way! We've made structures which lasted thousands of years in the past)
we feel that we're needed somewhere and tend to build things that need us to fill that hole of neediness that we expect, in a projection
being able to both see the unconditional love of nature and the very focused, distorted, fetishistic, conditional love of man's works
