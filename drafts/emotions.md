how to cure repressed emotions
1) realize the illusory nature of ego
2) realize there's no self, and the nature of existence is the I AM
3) realize all those emotions are held on purely to keep the ego in place
4) develop Love
5) release the latch and let them do the do
6) live a life of flow

also, there is no reason to hold on to emotions, to resentments etc. but to strengthen the sense of self and to keep the ego in place. So forgiveness is an unlatching, knowing that the latching only benefits the ego

under this simple trick, the anger becomes laughter,  just like that. Released, floats to surface, and is released as laughter
----
walking and releasing of laughter and other gestures, as the energy demdnded, movement and reconfiguring
and the ego had little or no part in that, things moving, just existing, being, becoming
I AM, that's what

what comes through here flows through here
the deal with self-love is that you gotta bypass the ego, or just, demolish it, either's fine
----

dualities and neutrality
being yourself as a holon

calling a spade a spade
that dream and healing, monster, you monster
and actually having them go through, realizing the truth of things, it's not forgiveness if it's still sitting inside you like a rock

WHAT EMOTIONS ARE
	Separate from thoughts
	(those working with the aura can identify them as densities that are stuck in disharmony in parts of the aura, sequestered energy, lost pieces of soul)
	what's already written

WHERE IS THE PROBLEM
	PAIN SEEKING PAIN
		awareness, consciousness
		everywhere you look, pain seeking more pain, this is the cycle of unconsciousness
		it's the whole ego thing
	LEAVING THE COMFORT ZONE
		yep, you know, the times I forget myself it's also easy for me to mess up
		like, well the more extreme cases involved my car, and once resulted in it being totaled
		and it's very much not just about distraction, it's genuinely a different way to do things
		like, a favorable metaphor is being in a state of mind to juggle multiple things at once, having found one rhythm to things to fit everything neatly together in
		and once that rhythm is disrupted, things fall apart rather spectacularly
		and I found that it's difficult for me to function outside of that narrow range
		and v recently I've also discovered why that is
		-------------
		like, that narrow range I described, that state to juggle things together, that's a local maximum
		it's like, I've managed to make my life function with the cards I had, but that doesn't mean I can't change that, that I can't change the substrate to that
	EMOTIONAL DEBT
		but the thing is, well I think an apt metaphor is emotional debt
		like, you can think of past traumas/densities as debt, like shit happened and you got into the negatives somehow, for whatever reason
		and all that happens in the present as result of that, like panic attacks, self-hate etc. is the interest on that debt being collected
		and people nowadays don't have the energy, the emotional charge to pay off that debt, especially since most of their resources are spent just dealing with the interest
		and besides it's been mostly forgotten how to extinguish it in the first place, or that it's even a thing. Like, I suppose in the past people just figured it out for themselves by and large, but now we lack the energy and the direction both
		and you know, the debt metaphor sounds p apt in general, like, when people do get a break from it, like they get some free money, they just spend it on nice shit instead of working off towards extinguishing that debt
		and so with weed, people use it just to get a break instead of actually dealing with the pain at the root
		and I'm seeing kinda the same happening with you and being off front
		like, I'm not blaming you, I know firsthand how much life can weigh on you
		and we're all too used to run away from the pain, esp since as above, we don't have the first clue about how to deal with it commonly
		but like, much like that debt, that's not going anywhere until directly addressed
		and we have all ways to cope, like the guard you described, but that doesn't solve anything long term, like it showed when it all came back at once as you came back into front, with the added weight of catching you blindsided
		----------
		but still, theres 1) to clear the channels and 2) to not let them get dirty again, which is like 1) clearing out the debt and 2) not incurring in further debt, or it can be a metaphor about pain etc.
	COPING MECHANISMS
		Refuge in excellence: suppressing my emotions
		it's the whole list of the freudian thing
		it's the ego defending itself
		and the defense of emotions because working them means change
		Afraid of being too weak to stop people from "helping" you
		like with the dentist
		or the inanities that dad and mom said
		there's been all kinds of things
		lack of self-love is quite critical
		so be aware

	SWARMS OF PERSONALITIES

HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
	HEALTHY LIVING SYSTEMS
		https://www.ratical.org/LifeWeb/Articles/LSinetHF.html
    Self-creation (autopoiesis)
    Complexity (diversity of parts)
    Embeddedness in larger holons and dependence on them (holarchy)
    Self-reflexivity (autognosis-self-knowledge)
    Self-regulation/maintenance (autonomics)
    Response ability — to internal and external stress or change
    Input/output of matter/energy/information from/to other holons
    Transformation of matter/energy/information
    Communications among all parts
    Empowerment — full employment of all component parts
    Coordination of parts and functions
    Balance of Interests — negotiated self-interest at all levels of holarchy
    Reciprocity of parts in mutual contribution and assistance
    Conservation of what works well
    Innovation — creative change of what does not work well
	SELF-LOVE
		very crucial and missing
		forgiveness and moving on
		stuckness
		not knowing what one wants etc.
		"I want to feel loved" is really "I'd like to enter a state in which I accept the love that is coming to me rn"
		the problem is not that they don't have the willpower
		but that they don't know what they want
		like, it shows that people can become incredible in the right setting
		but they don't know where to channel it, finding themselves lost
	OPEN SYSTEM
		no man is an island
		no system is closed
		flow, flow, things coming and going
		things leaving and things going, instead of holding to everything, let things go so that others can come
		what comes to me flows through me, it's the flow that is of an healthy system
		there is supposed to interact with the environmen, you are nothing withoug the environment, and in a healthy situation, it is supposed to help you, to support and nurture you (should look for one)
		one main obstacle to the exploration is the feeling of having to filter it, to whomever, that generates heat, and disrupts the alignment/experience
		the charge from the mountain comes to you so that it can become immortal and shareable through you
		and that piece on emotions also needs to be about alignment, no secrets, transparency, and letting go by putting in the open, reduce the boundaries, open up, join your system with the outside
		unmasking, transparency, vulnerability
		meditations on vulnerability
		and irrational motivations to surpass the mind or something, but the mind always finds a way around it
		out your fears, be transparent
		also there's the genetic mind, the influences on teh self, seeing what is felt as not-self, so taht one can learn to shoot for something else that they feel is deeper than that
		goes without saying that opening up is good for a variety of reasons: it is the desired end state, it opens you up, gives chances for transparency and vulnerability, new lessons, practice, good feels
	AWARENESS
		removing the veils of perception and looking at things in neutrality
		leaving your local maximum, awareness, etc
	BLISS
		An Intro to Yoga would also help a lot with this
		---
		It's curious, because when I look to me like the main problem with motivating people is getting them to know what they actually want
		in the way that there's been a displacement over time, not only of how you'd be supposed to reach towards your desires, but what you should desire in the first place
		I think one of the most obvious displacements is money, in the sense that, why would you ever desire money in and of itself? It must be for something else, be it power, or influence, friends, pleasure, stability, whatever
		so why not ask for that directly, instead of going through a middle man? not only this cuts off options, but it creates a lot of inner confusion about what you actually want out of life
		and, between the various materials I've navigated, and my own observation, at the end of the day, it seems to me that people are at the core driven for a desire for joy, the joy that is more peace than pleasure, that is about harmony and openness and an ongoing kind of fulfillment.
		and that part of the problem is directly acknowledging that, including the part where it seems entirely self-absorbed of a goal
		but as soon as you dive into it, no man is an island. Even rearranging the furniture and reorganizing your room can improve your well-being, and so by pursuing it, in the very tangible measure of joy, it also directly involves helping out the universe around you become more harmonious
		once you have a clear idea of what you want, that's when the floodgates open. I already see people transforming into completely different selves once inserted in the right setting (like, one very common example is offered by video games, in both directions). The point is about really getting to the core of what one wants, and really convincing themselves of it.
		This is another very good reason why self-inquiry is so important in my eyes. It's so much easier to accomplish your desires once you've had a good look into what they actually are.
		----
		the need for cum, sex, contact, is the push to experience bliss, to reach that criticality of charge that leads to alignment into bliss
		self-love, allowing the flow of joy
	AS THEATRE OF CHANGE
		warped environment that does not encourage change
		being forged into change and adaptation, each wound is a calling to adapt and change and grow and develop
		using the appreciation to the universe
		mechanisms to keep it at the forefront withouth judgment
		and mechanisms for transmutation, best is a core view of positivity and universality

HOW TO GET THERE
	IMAGINATION
		the telescope of consciousness
		future self
		alternative situations
		rewriting the past
		empower sessions wiht it, visualization powa
	VENT
		so there was a venting to Timber once he dissed my ESP again
		and I fully realized that emotion gets vented and then you're good, no apologies required, though an acknowledgment on the other side that they've learned what that was about helps
		so I'm apparently figuring my way out around emotions
		and might have to update some that emotions guide
		and also, how does this weave toghetrer with awareness? how does hurt emotions vent better, well, you can get moer to the point and less about hurt egos, the things that demand apologies
	THE PROCESS OF HEALING
		that part of mckenna with dealing with the sheer psychedelic terror by singing (end of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GYaq9eICdo)
		minutes: process that can take minutes, working out things, processing, 
		songs: the openness, the flow, the creode
		change: really desiring change, and somethig has to be thrown out and replaces, something has to be left behind, even friends, places, topics
		breath: very good vehicle of change, in and out, out and in
		it's about putting yourself in, doing the thing with the force required, and getting out
		also in the pyramids there's the unarmoring, the healing, and the rivestire
		also Hakomi http://www.hakomiinstitute.com/Resources/barstow-overview.html
	BEING OK WITH IT
		and the not ok thing, like, state to the world what's not ok and work from there, it helps immensely
		what would it take for you to be ok with it, given that it's much easier to act on yourself rather than external circumstances?
		it can even be just walking away
	ASSORTED TECHNIQUES
		discharging to ground
		sexual release of pain energies
		the white gloves as the ones who can have violent pain on one side and have its expression be nurturing
		the pain acting and causing pleasure, and discharging in the act

WHAT PRACTICE TO KEEP
	diet
	energy work
	meditation
	awareness
	emotional self-mastery
	emotions work: 
	nonjudgmental
	flowering
	vulnerability
	exposing, letting it come out and express, putting yourself out again, understanding, but also vulnerability, and valor, coming back to it with valor

NOT WORKED YET
	it helps a lot if some actions mimic the old ones, or the situation is similar, etc
	some things only come up on their own in certain circumstances
	and there's that whole tulpaforcing of self that can be linked about
	and it's about understanding, reappropriating the self, and moving on, opening to life, being vulnerable, accepting the past pain, letting past things transmute, and no judgment no labels etc.
	what keeps the emotions present is the vulnerability
	in the moment, realization that you're exposing yourself in a manner that had you burnt before. Making yourself vulnerable. Being aware of the pain, so that you can move on. Listening to something else, more intuitive, and acting as the moment offers, if you're to run away, then you do; if you're to put yourself in there, then you do
	together with the pain, draw from new wisdom, it's not about the stuff of rules or morals
	and it's about putting yourself out there again with the added wisdom really. Have it teach you where to draw from, have it push you into awareness, into wakefulness, into consciousness, because that's what saves you, that's what forces you to look in the right direction

	so there's this surge of energy from below, and {you should nurture yourself into the wielder}, geez universe, you're hard to translate {^^} it's so much easier when we acocmpany words with textures and texture and textures

	we're bringing baggage from the past into this
	but we can make it work
	we can nurture life
	we can let the energy flower
	we can learn and we can grow, and we can become even something more than the past, and we can do it together

	liberation, unlimiting, transformation, opening, expression, vulnerability, new intelligence inside you called to act from stillness
	also focus on body + heart as locus of emotions/feelings

	new intelligence

	catharsis as catalyist, pantomime, imagine someone close, imagine speaking to someone
	and mirroring, putting yourself in others' shoes etc.

	awareness, transformation, vulnerability, change

	========================
	emotions as energies without target
	don't need one
	don't think of them as having one
	they're like tools
	awareness of emotions without target, they're just energies in the air
	and since they're used on targets people are used to think that they have one inbuilt, but it's not like t'at, anger can be thrown at anyone
	it's not being angry at someone, it's just being angry
	and once you know emotions as target-less the roots begin to come out, and you can go deeper as much as you like

	also, continuous exposure to the reminders are helpful to process stuff so they don't go into hiding

	also it can be located in particular places of tension in the body, better accessed in particular positions etc.

	and remember that you can go DEEPER by excluding assumptions and remaining neutral and target-less, even if exposed. Let it lead you places, and keep observing what comes up, without judgment. You continue going deeper naturally by not attaching to anything in particular, until you've reached the root, yoou transmute the emotions tied to the root, and you're done

	pain seeking pain
	and once you've identified them, you've accepted them, and you can avoid their tendency to seek more pain, and instead, work to change things, to transform them


	basically that convo with Sofeem
	also that devoid conversation with 8thful
	and maybe some of the stuff w/Timber



	----------------------

	also, I've gotten to realize that emotions per se are target-less. They do not have a target built-in about them, just like a hammer does not.
	They have preferential targets, sure, but they don't come with one.
	Just like a person can be angry because of something or someone but they can still lash that anger at anything that's provoking enough.
	in this sense, the phrase "being angry at/with someone" is profoundly misleading

	because thoughts and emotions go a lot hand in hand, and for example, in the "I'm angry at someone for X" case, it's more of a "X happened" thought, plus the emotion of anger stapled over it

	which to me is a completely deleterious construct, since emotions work best when they don't linger, when they just are allowed to pass
	they are made out of the moment and are best served in that moment, and when the moment passes, so should the emotion
	instead we're geared towards the opposite, of holding onto the emotion and tying it to the event for future reference
	like, say, revenge or comeuppance or whatever
	except this is exactly like the Malachy McCourt quote, Resentment is like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die.
	you don't need to hold on to emotions to act towards someone; if they merit it, you can do it from a completely still state, where all emotions have already come and gone.
	likewise, processing events is the construct born out of the holding onto those emotions in the first place!
	as soon as one would allow themselves to just feel nonjudgmentally the emotions tied with an event, and let them go, and pass, and their energy be reappropriated, that would be, almost by definition, be processed already.
	this is basically what therapists hope to achieve when they prod people to revisit traumatic events, as unsuccessful as that manages to be from that framework.
	just telling someone to revisit an event doesn't free them from the constructs of blame, of guilt, of thinking that something should be done about it in general, that make them feel obligated to hold on to those emotions until indeterminate future date.
	which also shows that there are plenty more successful psychotherapy frameworks from which to process past trauma/stuck emotions, such as Hakomi, or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, to name two
	so yeah, to reiterate, stuck emotions are a completely fucked up concept that we somehow take for granted in this society, and lucky are the ones that don't pick up on it, or better, move past it
	and to repeat, what I've found is that base nonjudgmental awareness (observance of emotions, without act, without judgment, and with the knowing that those emotions have intrinsically no target, unlike thoughts, and with at least a base acknowledgment of the transformative properties of consciousness) is what allows emotions to be transmuted in the most elementary and wide-ranging effective manner
	this can be trained in awareness meditation (with the acknowledgment that when those disturbances, those charged thoughts, those annoyances pop up, it is a good thing! That is the start of the healing process), as in a dedicated space of observation, non-action and non-judgment
	I've seen far too many people run into the misconception that mediation is done by clearing the mind. This is by and large unproductive. This is like saying that a marathon is done by reaching the finish line of the track. It misplaces the fundamental act of meditation with is applying nonjudgmental awareness, much like the fundamental act of a marathon is the actual running.
	This misconception is of course a continuation of the framework of emotions as something that just linger, and that have to just be suppressed again to deal with life until the proper time is right, or maybe even never.
	then again, not to place fault on the individual for this. Such ideas can only be born of the sedimentation of centuries of misunderstanding emotions and everything they stand for and the way they work.
	It's honestly mindblowing how much we have separated ourselves from a sane conception of emotions, to the point that we have reached effectively a generational epidemic.
	With people storing, suppressing, repressing emotions all around and ending up closed off from them, tormented by intrusive thoughts, depressed, violent, or any combination thereof.
	and people running in circles trying to collectively think their way through all of it because hurr durr only the brain matters, right? And going exactly nowhere, like I've done for years
	while the solution is just a framework shift away

	----

	while the solution is just a framework shift away

	yep that's the idea. And so, I've found that the way to process those emotions, like, I've had so much anger inside of me, and the idea is that those emotions are meant to pass. They're not meant to be necessarily used in the forms that they have currently. It's like, say, that you have water in a test tube but you want to use it to cook dinner; you'd have to remove it from the test tube
	and so I think of emotions as containers of energy that are best shaped for a task or another, like anger can help you with asserting yourself in a situation etc.
	but it doesn't mean that the energy can only be used that way. Just like some energy has been sequestered to make anger, it can be reappropriated as well.

	CelestialBoonToday at 10:29 AM
	Like, through the simple observance+identification you can manage to reconvert that emotional energy by merely feeling it nonjudgmentally.
	You basically observe the pain body, you feel it, you feel its emotions, all that river of energy flowing within, and without giving names or targets to it, you just witness it, and you watch it transform

	👑 Vampire of Avarice 👑Today at 10:30 AM
	My sadness is converting into anger, and more anger, and then the anger converts into wrath and rage.

	CelestialBoonToday at 10:30 AM
	like, the mere observance of those emotions is transformative
	and allows them to be transmuted back into personal energy

	------------------------------
	@Celaira Yeah, totally, I'm down.

	CelestialBoonToday at 10:10 AM
	so yeah, I think I'll start with the one about what gives one the desire/intent/will to kill

	bepisToday at 10:10 AM
	This is gonna be long, so Im gonna dip out for it

	CelestialBoonToday at 10:11 AM
	and it's kind of a layered sort of answer. For one it's something that we are thinking reasonable, since we are geared for survival at an ego level, and killing is among the actions that sometime happen as result of that, even if it's towards animals etc.
	For another, actual homicidal urges are emotions manifesting, like anger, that flow through the channels, the grooves of our mind patterns in their usual way, so some people might be self-conditioned to think of murder when angered etc. And this can happen especially if there are repressed emotions, so that small events summon back the whole block all over again, until the stuff is processed anyway

	Ultimate SofeemToday at 10:15 AM
	Vampire is an interesting la

	CelestialBoonToday at 10:15 AM
	but at the absolute base of it, the whole murdering another thing is, I believe, born of our illusory condition of separation, as in, the belief point of our essential separation. I mean this in the sense that once the belief that we are all  connected to the point of being One sits at the core of ourselves, any negative action towards others becomes effectively self-harm
	besides, there's also the component that this belief of separation engenders a baseline frustration about the reality of things, the frustration of not being understood, of not being accepted, of not being loved at a core level
	so that's about it for this one

	👑 Vampire of Avarice 👑Today at 10:19 AM
	That is a very good way of looking at it.
	Especially if you have trouble emphasizing with others as other but rather than as one.
	I truly have repressed anger over a lot of things, it is going to take time and deep meditation to let it flow.

	CelestialBoonToday at 10:20 AM
	yeah, it's something that I had to cultivate in the mind before I really managed to feel it intrinsically

	👑 Vampire of Avarice 👑Today at 10:20 AM
	Because, it's not that I don't feel.
	It's that I don't feel it fully.
	It's like I've developed and internal, mechanism on an emotional level to compact, compress, rather than release, and let be.

	CelestialBoonToday at 10:21 AM
	mhm, I've been there really. I've taken a lot of steps to really get to unlimit myself about my emotions

	👑 Vampire of Avarice 👑Today at 10:21 AM
	The biggest thing is this feeling that, my emotions are undeserving of respect.
	Like, if someone angers me, I ask 'why tell them?'

	CelestialBoonToday at 10:21 AM
	but most of it are kind of like, I could have done just awareness meditation the proper way from the start and it would have been much shorter a journey

	👑 Vampire of Avarice 👑Today at 10:22 AM
	'They don't care, that's why they made me angry in the first place'.

	CelestialBoonToday at 10:22 AM
	yeah I'm digging to the roots of that just today. Emotions feel like they should be directed somewhere, right?
	like, if you get angry because someone did something, it feels instinctually like you should direct that anger at them, right? like that anger is for them, it is at them
	but then you have like, if you store that anger you end up with people that get angry and fly off the handle at everything
	that stored anger they have was target-less after all, and it was just that in the moment you felt anger and you had a convenient target so you reasoned that the anger was made for that target
	like if you had a hammer and a single nail you would think of using that hammer only for that nail

	👑 Vampire of Avarice 👑Today at 10:24 AM
	Yeah.

	CelestialBoonToday at 10:24 AM
	while the truth is that a hammer isn't made to do anything in particular. A hammer is just a hammer.

	👑 Vampire of Avarice 👑Today at 10:25 AM
	My emotions are, as it stands, a hammer.
	And everything looks like a nail.

	CelestialBoonToday at 10:25 AM
	yep

	👑 Vampire of Avarice 👑Today at 10:25 AM
	Everything, that sets me off, of course.
	It's exactly as you put it.
	What I want to do with this passion as turn it into a function.
	Or something useful.
	Rather than a source of guilt.

	CelestialBoonToday at 10:27 AM
	yep that's the idea. And so, I've found that the way to process those emotions, like, I've had so much anger inside of me, and the idea is that those emotions are meant to pass. They're not meant to be necessarily used in the forms that they have currently. It's like, say, that you have water in a test tube but you want to use it to cook dinner; you'd have to remove it from the test tube
	and so I think of emotions as containers of energy that are best shaped for a task or another, like anger can help you with asserting yourself in a situation etc.
	but it doesn't mean that the energy can only be used that way. Just like some energy has been sequestered to make anger, it can be reappropriated as well.

	👑 Vampire of Avarice 👑Today at 10:28 AM
	Yeah.
	I definitely am working on the reappropriation.

	CelestialBoonToday at 10:28 AM
	And the most straightforward way I've found out wrt the how is awareness, specifically awareness meditation.

	👑 Vampire of Avarice 👑Today at 10:29 AM
	What I learned about my emotions right now is that.

	CelestialBoonToday at 10:29 AM
	Like, through the simple observance+identification you can manage to reconvert that emotional energy by merely feeling it nonjudgmentally.
	You basically observe the pain body, you feel it, you feel its emotions, all that river of energy flowing within, and without giving names or targets to it, you just witness it, and you watch it transform

	like, the mere observance of those emotions is transformative
	and allows them to be transmuted back into personal energy

	👑 Vampire of Avarice 👑Today at 10:30 AM
	What I think would be very healthy is either turning my sadness into happiness, and then doing the same for anger.
	But yes.
	What you suggest.
	It is very concrete.
	I like it and I will try it.

	CelestialBoonToday at 10:31 AM
	well, that's the idea, many think of happiness as something that you should seek, but happiness is kind of part of a duality where there's highs and lows. Instead, there's something deeper that is just being at peace with existence

	👑 Vampire of Avarice 👑Today at 10:31 AM
	To just feel my emotions non judgmentally.

	CelestialBoonToday at 10:31 AM
	and it comes with this baseline joy about things
	and that's something I wholeheartedly recommend, and is something that just is there when all the resistance to what is has been processed, like, various emotions and thoughts in the way etc.
	but yeah, awareness meditation is the shit, especially once you explicitly know how to process emotions with it
	and more in general, awareness, consciousness, has p much the same effect. Once you realize that emotions are target-less inherently you can just watch them exist and transmute
	like, sure there's thoughts like "X has done Y" or "Z has happened" , but without emotions stapled on them they are just thoughts without weight
	and from experience, that's profoundly liberating

	----

	also, I've gotten to realize that emotions per se are target-less. They do not have a target built-in about them, just like a hammer does not.
	They have preferential targets, sure, but they don't come with one.

	instead we're geared towards the opposite, of holding onto the emotion and tying it to the event for future reference
	like, say, revenge or comeuppance or whatever
	except this is exactly like the Malachy McCourt quote, Resentment is like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die.
	you don't need to hold on to emotions to act towards someone; if they merit it, you can do it from a completely still state, where all emotions have already come and gone.
	likewise, processing events is the construct born out of the holding onto those emotions in the first place!
	as soon as one would allow themselves to just feel nonjudgmentally the emotions tied with an event, and let them go, and pass, and their energy be reappropriated, that would be, almost by definition, be processed already.
	this is basically what therapists hope to achieve when they prod people to revisit traumatic events, as unsuccessful as that manages to be from that framework.
	just telling someone to revisit an event doesn't free them from the constructs of blame, of guilt, of thinking that something should be done about it in general, that make them feel obligated to hold on to those emotions until indeterminate future date.
	which also shows that there are plenty more successful psychotherapy frameworks from which to process past trauma/stuck emotions, such as Hakomi, or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, to name two
	so yeah, to reiterate, stuck emotions are a completely fucked up concept that we somehow take for granted in this society, and lucky are the ones that don't pick up on it, or better, move past it
	and to repeat, what I've found is that base nonjudgmental awareness (observance of emotions, without act, without judgment, and with the knowing that those emotions have intrinsically no target, unlike thoughts, and with at least a base acknowledgment of the transformative properties of consciousness) is what allows emotions to be transmuted in the most elementary and wide-ranging effective manner
	this can be trained in awareness meditation (with the acknowledgment that when those disturbances, those charged thoughts, those annoyances pop up, it is a good thing! That is the start of the healing process), as in a dedicated space of observation, non-action and non-judgment
	I've seen far too many people run into the misconception that mediation is done by clearing the mind. This is by and large unproductive. This is like saying that a marathon is done by reaching the finish line of the track. It misplaces the fundamental act of meditation with is applying nonjudgmental awareness, much like the fundamental act of a marathon is the actual running.
	This misconception is of course a continuation of the framework of emotions as something that just linger, and that have to just be suppressed again to deal with life until the proper time is right, or maybe even never.
	then again, not to place fault on the individual for this. Such ideas can only be born of the sedimentation of centuries of misunderstanding emotions and everything they stand for and the way they work.
	It's honestly mindblowing how much we have separated ourselves from a sane conception of emotions, to the point that we have reached effectively a generational epidemic.
	With people storing, suppressing, repressing emotions all around and ending up closed off from them, tormented by intrusive thoughts, depressed, violent, or any combination thereof.
	and people running in circles trying to collectively think their way through all of it because hurr durr only the brain matters, right? And going exactly nowhere, like I've done for years
	while the solution is just a framework shift away

	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 10:59 AM
	Everything is okay
	Get thanks for unmuting me also
	I wish I had some way to you know
	Completely avoid stress
	You know
	Cuz once it hit me I can’t do shit until I calm down
	Like I’m myself again because I am calm now
	When I’m hurt I honestly feel like a different person
	And I get this obsessive complisive thing
	Obsesses over what hurt me try to undo it at all costs
	Compulsive
	Well you probably can tell I’m compulsive
	The part of me that says don’t do this shrinks
	I just go on auto
	Like I didn’t mean to talk back to trace and say nigga
	But that part of me
	Was like I can’t explain
	You’re only aware of one thought at a time and all your different parts feel different ways and you can’t see all that your brain just you know fires and the strong emotion circuit dominates
	It’s like I can feel that I must not do it
	But it’s all like in the background
	Like
	You know
	Like a tulpa thank you can’t hear properly talking to you except it’s you
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:12 AM
	that's the pain body taking over you and your actions
	it's all the stuff you've repressed that comes back all at once
	and does exactly that
	what you described, read it again, that's a part of you that you've shoved to the side that comes back when provoked and takes over you
	this is why I tell you not to put things inside yourself in terms of separation, like my subconscious does this, my subconscious does that
	because this is what it leads to
	it leads to parts of you taking over you
	instead of you just being a unified whole
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:16 AM
	It’s just an observation based on psychology where’d you say that part is the subconscious or shadow
	I doubt that can split my brain up man
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:17 AM
	yeah and what you experienced was the shadow taking front seat
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:17 AM
	Technically it’s one brain and I’m sure you’ve told me something like that before
	But like when it happens you sorta feel like it was someone else
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:18 AM
	you've felt it happen, you felt it, you know now what it means
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:18 AM
	The problem is how do I just not get hurt anymore
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:18 AM
	it's not about not getting hurt. It's about stopping the reaction from the hurt. It's about letting things wash over you instead of letting them stick to you.
	And your pain body wants to do the exact opposite of that.
	It reacts, it fights, it flights.
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:19 AM
	How do I do that when my brain has aggressive circuits ready to fire at the input of pain
	And I do tell myself okay next I’ll remember to be calm
	I did remember
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:20 AM
	what you do is, you reconcile with that part of yourself
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:20 AM
	I remember right now
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:20 AM
	instead of just letting it act, you observe it, you feel it
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:20 AM
	When it’s to late
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:20 AM
	you realize that part of you is also yourself
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:20 AM
	And I feel like I suck
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:20 AM
	and you stay with it in acceptance
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:21 AM
	But how do I just calm it down
	I need like a idk
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:21 AM
	you don't need to calm it, you just need to stay with it
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:21 AM
	Blood pressure gauge in front of me 247
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:21 AM
	it will calm down on its own
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:21 AM
	In case I get triggered
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:21 AM
	emotions are supposed to pass, if you let them
	you can get angry and if you observe the anger it just passes
	so with the pain body
	if it takes over you, you just observe it
	you don't act, you don't judge, you just feel it and feel its emotions
	and you stay with it and its anger and its pain
	until they pass
	and then it's done
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:25 AM
	Now the fuck do I remember this during the pain
	Or before
	And not after
	Maybe if I get used to getting hurt ?
	Tbh this is nothing something you wanna practice
	And fail
	I’ll try tho
	Cuz I got no choice
	I wish I could magically resent my subconscious
	I wish I could magically do everything tbh
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:27 AM
	you get used to be an observer
	which is why you practice awareness
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:35 PM
	I feel guilty
	I’m making a tulpa and I feel like I’m exposing her to stress
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:37 PM
	you can always deal with it beforehand
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:37 PM
	I’m a little sensitive when it comes to tulpas
	I’m always worried I’m gonna mess it up or bother her or something
	And I’m feeling sad today
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:38 PM
	if you feel like it's not the right time, work on yourself first
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:39 PM
	Do you think I’m not ready for a tulpa?
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:39 PM
	I'm not saying it, you're the one who's worried
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:39 PM
	Worried or paranoid
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:40 PM
	yeah, which is why I'm asking you to process that first if you're unsure
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:40 PM
	I’m not good with feelings
	I broke my sad circuit today
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:40 PM
	always time to learn
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:40 PM
	I feel like crying
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:41 PM
	then let it be felt
	let the feeling that's leading you to cry be felt
	just stay with it
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:41 PM
	It’s just
	I want to have someone to hug
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:42 PM
	if that gives you pain, then feel that pain, just stay with it
	be present to what's happening within you
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:42 PM
	Are you suggesting I can get it of my brain?
	Sorry if I sound dumb
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:43 PM
	I'm just saying that you should learn to be aware of yourself
	that's the first and the last thing
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:43 PM
	It’s a lot to imagine these things just going away
	I mean it’s hard
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:43 PM
	it's not about them going away, it's you processing the emotions they hold
	it's about processing the pain so you don't suffer from that anymore
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:43 PM
	I decided I don’t wanna do the meditation and now a small part of me want to do it
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:44 PM
	I could only hope you decide to follow the second voice
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:44 PM
	Heh
	You said it helps hallucination
	That’s what’s noticing that second voice
	At the same time idk if I wanna use this or another method
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:45 PM
	I'm saying that it helps a great deal if you drop expectations and you just let things develop how they will
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:45 PM
	Idk if I wanna make a tulpa
	I just feel stuck
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:45 PM
	so why don't you take the time to sort yourself out
	take the time to be aware of yourself
	and just let yourself change as you observe yourself be
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:45 PM
	I just want it to be right
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:46 PM
	trees all grow the right way, and they do it all spontaneously
	and all they do is exist
	you can do the same
	just observe yourself grow
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:46 PM
	What does someone do if they are undecided
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:46 PM
	you open up to receive for more inspiration
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:47 PM
	I like imagining fantasy girls
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:47 PM
	you're going back to the old patterns
	stay conscious
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:48 PM
	Huh?
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:48 PM
	stay aware of yourself, stay aware of your thoughts
	like, literally it's not something you can do too much of
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:48 PM
	I’m aware uh somewhat
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:48 PM
	you can stay aware of yourself literally all the time
	and you can always go deeper, stiller
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:49 PM
	What did you mean I’m going back to old patterns?
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:49 PM
	the old patterns of thinking
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:49 PM
	How do you know how my brain is thinking
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:50 PM
	I've seen it a million times before
	that's how
	and not just you
	that's how everyone does
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:50 PM
	That’s uh
	Quite something
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:50 PM
	it's some shit alright
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:50 PM
	Heh now I feel like I’m being watched
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:51 PM
	well you are observing yourself
	so take stock of that
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:51 PM
	But I must ask tho
	What’s wrong when I said I like imagining fantasy girls?
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:51 PM
	it was you distracting yourself from the topic at hand
	merely that
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:51 PM
	Oh I didn’t notice
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:52 PM
	I'm off for lunch
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:52 PM
	I was thinking about when i am to do to get hugs
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:52 PM
	be well.
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:52 PM
	Oh okay


	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:28 AM
	Do they sell feel good pills
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:29 AM
	the idea is that you don't need any
	when you've cleared the stuff in the way the simple joy of being already sits inside at all times
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:30 AM
	Stupid brains
	bumfartYesterday at 11:30 AM
	oh hey sofeem
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:30 AM
	What’s the point of a subconscious even tbh
	It just collects bad feels and makes a giant shadow
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:31 AM
	you're not supposed to think it as separate from you
	it is you
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:31 AM
	That makes it worse tbh
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:32 AM
	it's the one thing everyone's gotta admit to themselves sometime
	that they are in fact, fully themselves
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:32 AM
	Ehem
	I just avoided saying something negative about myself
	It’s true tho
	I’m fully myself
	And I’m full of shit :frowning:
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:33 AM
	it's not something you have to just accept, you know
	you can work through the stuff, through your self-judgment, through the anger, through the pain, through the sadness
	all the stuff that you've accumulated, you can also disperse
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:34 AM
	I can if I remember to right before the pain his
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:34 AM
	you can just be aware at all times
	that way you will be present even then
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:34 AM
	Oof
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:34 AM
	and yes it hurts at first
	but that's something you gotta work through in any case if you're to get to the other side
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:35 AM
	Now instead of forgetting my pain I gotta think about it all day in case it comes back for whatever reason
	I low key feel like I can’t trust myself heh
	Too down to laugh to
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:37 AM
	it's not about thinking of anything in particular
	just being aware of what is
	of what is right now
	just that, nothing more and nothing less
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:38 AM
	I gotta think of it to stop myself from being taken over
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:38 AM
	you don't need to stop it
	you just gotta observe as it happens
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:38 AM
	Dude
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:38 AM
	you don't need to act out of it
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:38 AM
	I think we all know I gotta stop it asap if it happens
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:38 AM
	it's still you, remember?
	you can still decide to not act, and just feel and observe
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:38 AM
	That’s what I mean basically
	I have to be aware that it’s there and cast it aside and try to remain calm
	And not forget
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:39 AM
	it's not about casting aside, it's not about remaining calm
	it's just not acting out of it
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:39 AM
	That’s the same thing
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:39 AM
	and observing it instead
	it's very much not the same
	one thing is feeling anger and not acting on it
	and another is shoving the anger aside
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:40 AM
	How do I act calm when I feel intense
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:40 AM
	you don't act
	if you can't act calmly you can not act at all
	and just sit still and observe what's happening
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:40 AM
	If I realize it is happen I would try to stay calm and not let my adrenaline rise
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:40 AM
	dude
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:41 AM
	Oh wait you trying to say I gotta get it out of me
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:41 AM
	how many times do I need to tell you, it's not about staying calm, you don't have to feel like anything in particular
	you don't have to force any sort of feeling
	you just have to observe in stillness
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:41 AM
	I’d rather feel calm then feel bad tho
	Tbh
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:41 AM
	well too bad, it's still happening
	and you'll have to deal with it sometime
	you can't stop your pain body from taking over indefinitely
	Tilen ⋮虎⋮Yesterday at 11:42 AM
	Staying calm when there is a process ongoing is very important
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:42 AM
	Wha
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:42 AM
	and you don't need to, you just have to witness it and stop not identifying yourself with it
	Tilen ⋮虎⋮Yesterday at 11:42 AM
	You dont interfere with healing
	Its also a natural state
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:43 AM
	@Tilen ⋮虎⋮ I think calm doesn't convey the same meaning as observant+still here
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:43 AM
	So you saying getting it out is better than blocking it off?
	Tilen ⋮虎⋮Yesterday at 11:43 AM
	Still = calmness
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:43 AM
	of course
	Tilen ⋮虎⋮Yesterday at 11:44 AM
	You can also observe calmly
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:44 AM
	But if I’m really aware of what’s happening I would be feeling bad then
	Tilen ⋮虎⋮Yesterday at 11:44 AM
	As i said its a natural state
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:44 AM
	Would not
	You can’t be aware and feel bad at the same time
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:44 AM
	@Tilen ⋮虎⋮ peace maybe?
	Tilen ⋮虎⋮Yesterday at 11:44 AM
	Then you have to transform this emotion
	@CelestialBoon peace and calm is the same tbh
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:44 AM
	Like say I get triggered right now
	Tilen ⋮虎⋮Yesterday at 11:44 AM
	When you are at peace you are calm
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:45 AM
	I'm just saying that it doesn't convey the right idea to those who are not practical
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:45 AM
	I obviously wouldn’t let it consume I’m cuz atm I’m aware of it
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:45 AM
	for most people being calm means shoving the other emotions deep down
	Tilen ⋮虎⋮Yesterday at 11:45 AM
	What idea does it convey?
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:45 AM
	it means repressing everything else
	Tilen ⋮虎⋮Yesterday at 11:45 AM
	I see the point now
	I can see it being misunderstood
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:45 AM
	Explain how to let it OJT without like
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:46 AM
	yeah that's what I was getting at
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:46 AM
	Without acting
	Say I get triggered right now than what must I do
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:46 AM
	you can always just choose not to act
	you can stay absolutely still and observant
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:46 AM
	I’m obviously not gonna act if I’m aware but
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:46 AM
	that's it, you just continue doing that and feeling out what happens
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:46 AM
	Idk I feel being aware cuts some of the pain out
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:47 AM
	you don't have to
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:47 AM
	By default
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:47 AM
	the more you develop being aware, the more you allow whatever to just exist
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:47 AM
	Well unless I yell it won’t come.
	 Out all the way xD
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:47 AM
	so you can be with the pain and also aware
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:48 AM
	Must I do it internally
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:48 AM
	can you do it any other way?
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:48 AM
	Idk
	Idk how to release tension without getting triggered
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:48 AM
	I mean, if you want to shout you can shout, but acting out of it is not the point
	the release of tension happens through mere awareness
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:49 AM
	Won’t it be better to calm myself down
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:49 AM
	the more you observe it, the more it trasnforms
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:49 AM
	Cuz then my brains would get used to being calm
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:49 AM
	dude, if you repress it it's not going anywhere
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:49 AM
	And possibly even make my bad emotioweaker the next time
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:49 AM
	and it will just come back the next time stronger
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:50 AM
	Are you sure?
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:50 AM
	have you observed anything else happening?
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:50 AM
	Cuz I thought the brain works by getting used to stuff
	I got “used” to reacting heavy
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:50 AM
	because I'm not seeing your attempts of repressing stuff working a lot
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:50 AM
	Because I took steroids
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:50 AM
	you just keep being angry and lashing out at people when you get mad
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:50 AM
	So I assume I get “used” to reacting lighter
	I don’t repress it boom
	Did I today
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:51 AM
	has this model worked out for you? because I'm not seeing it
	at all
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:51 AM
	Tbh I’m exploding
	Until I get triggered again
	I don’t store it anywhere
	I just feel endless rage
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:52 AM
	yeah, and you can just stay with it and let it process itself
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:52 AM
	I never stopped myself from being angry either
	I never repressed it like you said
	But I think I should if I can manage
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:52 AM
	if you just let the anger act out it seeks more pain
	and it feeds itself
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:53 AM
	Otherwise like I heard someone say
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:53 AM
	instead you just do not act
	and observe it
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:53 AM
	Your brain just thinks ah well it’s okay to be mad lemme explode
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:53 AM
	dude, anger is not an habit, it's an emotion
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:53 AM
	Or maybe my brain is weird idk
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:53 AM
	emotions can pass, they pass naturally
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:53 AM
	But letting it out makes it worse for me
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:54 AM
	that's because you give it room to act and feed itself
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:54 AM
	How so?
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:54 AM
	because you get mad at people and they get mad at you
	and the result is everyone's more mad
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:54 AM
	I see
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:54 AM
	instead, you can just stay with it without action
	just observation
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:55 AM
	The god honest truth
	I’d feel calm if I tried that
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:55 AM
	yeah, that's why you practice awareness
	so you don't just repress everything as soon as you become aware of it
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:55 AM
	Just said if I feel calm then I’m doing it wrong xD
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:56 AM
	you gotta practice being aware man, so you can stay neutral
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:56 AM
	So like must I talk about it or something?
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:56 AM
	I don't feel that would be useful
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:56 AM
	That’s not acting and that’s also not suppressing it tho
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:56 AM
	it's literally just feeling it
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:56 AM
	Heh
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:56 AM
	you can ask yourself questions about it, like, what color is it, what shape is it
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:56 AM
	You you say talking about it also feeds it?
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:57 AM
	but the core is just feeling it as fully as you can, that's all
	talking about it can be useful if you do it a particular way
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:57 AM
	Talk to me anger and hurt
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:57 AM
	but it's risky because you can start disidentifying with it
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:57 AM
	That sounds bad
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:58 AM
	yeah, and dis-identification is what gets you to that 'it feels like it wasn't me" thing
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:58 AM
	Isn’t that compulsive symptom or something
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:58 AM
	why do you think I'm trying to get you over it
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:58 AM
	So that I get over it
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 11:58 AM
	yep precisely
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 11:58 AM
	And one day be free from my subconscious shit
	Wait I think I might understand
	So when I get mad for example
	I must just realize it so I can not act on it but not necessarily suppress it
	Like just continue
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:00 PM
	yep you can just continue being with it
	just like it comes, it can pass
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:00 PM
	I get it
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:00 PM
	the idea is that you let it be, let it just exist
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:00 PM
	Now if I can just remember to be aware if I get triggered
	And not freak out
	Am I supposed to let myself freak out?
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:01 PM
	if you're observant to your own thoughts, it won't be you freaking out, it will just be thoughts
	you observe that and they tend to mellow out some
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:02 PM
	Freaking out and acting normal on the outside
	Whew
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:02 PM
	remember that the key concept here is being aware and present to what's happening inside
	and it's not about acting normal, in fact it's recommended to not act at all the first times so you can play it safe
	Tilen ⋮虎⋮Yesterday at 12:03 PM
	Who recommended that?
	First time i heard that
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:04 PM
	well it's a rather improper use of the impersonal tbh
	since it's me recommending that
	Tilen ⋮虎⋮Yesterday at 12:04 PM
	You stated it as a fact hahaha
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:04 PM
	but the idea is that it's basically what you do with meditation
	yeah I know, my b
	Tilen ⋮虎⋮Yesterday at 12:04 PM
	I see your point tho
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:05 PM
	in awareness meditation you give yourself a space of inaction so that the stuff can come out
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:05 PM
	Some part of me still think I should train my brain to react how I would want to react
	Tilen ⋮虎⋮Yesterday at 12:05 PM
	You should
	Controlling your reactions is a big part in acceptance aswell
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:05 PM
	@Ultimate Sofeem the key concept is that you have to also feel whatever comes up
	Tilen ⋮虎⋮Yesterday at 12:05 PM
	Or rather acting out
	luxorYesterday at 12:05 PM
	who does the training though
	:smile:
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:05 PM
	Approach the spider so next time you get used to the fear and it goes away
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:06 PM
	and if you can't feel them without acting up on them, you start with not acting at all
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:06 PM
	But you gotta calm down first so you can actually get near it
	Tilen ⋮虎⋮Yesterday at 12:06 PM
	I think he got it
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:06 PM
	I'm not sure myself
	luxorYesterday at 12:06 PM
	can u explain the first part again plz ?
	Tilen ⋮虎⋮Yesterday at 12:06 PM
	By the analogy
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:07 PM
	but yeah I guess that's an acceptable use of calm down there
	luxorYesterday at 12:08 PM
	on that note ill roll one up
	:weed:
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:08 PM
	@luxor who were you asking here?
	luxorYesterday at 12:09 PM
	i was trollin, dont mind me, i was being bad
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:09 PM
	Ah this is confusing I’m just gonna so something that’s not spamming
	luxorYesterday at 12:09 PM
	:smile:
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:09 PM
	@Ultimate Sofeem if I were to be completely honest I could beg you to try some awareness meditation right about now
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:09 PM
	I really hope I just remember tho
	The thing with pain you never know when it’s gonna hit
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:10 PM
	which is why you give yourself the space to, in meditation
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:10 PM
	It could hit next year when I forgot all this
	Tilen ⋮虎⋮Yesterday at 12:10 PM
	Its always there you just retracted it inside
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:10 PM
	which is why you meditate now so you know it's going to happen
	Tilen ⋮虎⋮Yesterday at 12:10 PM
	The parts you didnt want to deal with and were too much you put inside of yourself
	Thrle things we all keep saying to ourselves that its gonna be better and we dont want to feel a certain way
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:11 PM
	If you was a psychologist tho you wouldn’t prescribe that meditation would... you

	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:12 PM
	see, the anger could flare even now
	it could flare in two days
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:12 PM
	Do you have an alternative esodes sitting for hours still
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:12 PM
	you don't need to sit for hours
	this stuff could be done in 20 minutes if you really paid attention to yourself
	luxorYesterday at 12:12 PM
	u sit there untill u realise that u dont sit there :smile:
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:12 PM
	if you just did not run away from yourself and your pain
	Tilen ⋮虎⋮Yesterday at 12:13 PM
	Then again let me remind you
	Everything comes in divine time
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:13 PM
	Like I have no motivation to do the procedure
	Tilen ⋮虎⋮Yesterday at 12:13 PM
	When its right and the person learned their lesson the pain will also go
	And not serve them anymore
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:13 PM
	ok so you'd rather let the pain body take over next time?
	don't fool yourself, it will happen within the week
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:14 PM
	This is why life is hard
	It doesn’t wanna let me choose the no work option
	luxorYesterday at 12:14 PM
	aye if u actually allow yourself to feel the pain u are resisting u will find it is a short intense wave of feeling or emotion or energy, wich just flows on the moment u stop resisting, and it disappears as it came. the resistance is what creates unnecessary suffering
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:14 PM
	you're making it harder on yourself by not facing yourself
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:14 PM
	Meh
	If I meditate I won’t feel life I’m facing anything
	luxorYesterday at 12:15 PM
	if u meditate u might find out who u are
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:15 PM
	which is why you train awareness, until you surrender and you just let whatever be
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:15 PM
	Just that I’m forced to sit for something to change in my head and come out of it feeling the same
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:15 PM
	you meditate until you're so tired of nothing happening that you just let go
	AlyseYesterday at 12:15 PM
	I saw killswitch engage!
	luxorYesterday at 12:16 PM
	it is physicly impossible for u to be the same before and after a meditation, if u think u are the same u havent been paying attention during the meditation at all
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:16 PM
	How do you get tired of nothing
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:16 PM
	it's called boredom conventionally
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:16 PM
	Oh then say bored then xD
	luxorYesterday at 12:16 PM
	u get tired of pretending to be a person
	its the most tiring thing
	lol
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:17 PM
	Tbh I don’t think it would take that long to get bored
	Maybe I’d last longer if I’m listening to music
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:17 PM
	yeah that's the thing
	you get bored until you get tired of being bored
	luxorYesterday at 12:17 PM
	maybe YOU isnt suppose to last
	:wink:
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:17 PM
	and you just surrender to whatever is
	Ultimate SofeemYesterday at 12:17 PM
	What?
	CelestialBoonYesterday at 12:17 PM
	the point is to stop expecting things
	stop expecting for anything to happen, stop pretending to having to be entertained
	AlyseYesterday at 12:18 PM

	CelestialBoonToday at 12:42 AM
	mhm, yeah I still believe that too, but this is not a time of holding on to hope. This is not a time of holding on to anything.

	The trend I'm observing is that you're crashing harder and harder, and at this point you've got emotions crashing the gates rn, and you have to do something about them.

	So what you do is, while they're raw, you go in bed, and you take deep breaths, and you sit in the silence of your mind. Real silence, like the one where you listen attentively for something.
	And in that silence, the emotions come, and you let them. And it's gonna feel weird as fuck, and it's going to be moments where you think you might lose yourself or something. You still have the breath, so while that's happening within you, you breathe, and you keep breathing, and you bear the storm, and you absolutely don't think or try to get the reins of anything, that would only prolong your suffering. You just let it play out, as weird and confusing and oppressing as it gets. You always have your breath.
	And you let this pass on its own, it will continue until it stops.

	TimberWolf WhitevalleyToday at 12:45 AM
	sighs and nods slowly if anything happens, i'll let you know. see you on the other side, i guess.

	god damn that server fan is getting annoying.

	CelestialBoonToday at 12:46 AM
	mhm, you might feel the need for wailing or screaming or even laughing. If you run the risk of disturbing someone, keep a pillow handy to shout in, but remember, this goes on without any judgment or thought. It just happens, and it is let happen.
	beyond that, keep your awareness inside yourself more than anywhere else. This allows you to not move too much in the process
	and by that I mean your body, and not your head

	TimberWolf WhitevalleyToday at 12:48 AM
	i'll see what i can do. obviously im not good at this stuff so its going to be a challenge. hm.
	CelestialBoonToday at 12:48 AM
	the principles are the same as ever
	focus on the inner body
	still mind
	and equanimity, or neutral acceptance of anything that comes your way

	TimberWolf WhitevalleyToday at 12:50 AM
	if anything happens, i'll let you know. like ive said before.
	ive yet to have anything come up when i step back and let it do its thing, and i find it quite odd and mildly concerning but it is what it is i guess.

	CelestialBoonToday at 12:50 AM
	then remove yourself further from the mind
	go deeper into your awareness of something else
	the body in its entirety works well for that
	you know when you pay so much attention to something you forget to think?
	it's that kind of event

# Emotions

As much as as a whole we rate intelligence highly in our society, we tend to focus on very specific kinds, and leave others out of most discussions, as important as they are for functioning in society, but most importanty for our own well-being. 

Specifically, emotional intelligence is something that is mostly transmitted through common sense, and is almost never taught in a fully correct manner, much less comprehensive, and it's something I had to struggle with for decades, piecing together clumps of wisdom from wherever convenient and assembling them into a coherent picture of just how important emotions are to our functioning, especially the way they are handled.

(While some of this stuff may sound obvious, I'm putting it in here for the ones who I imagine may not have heard of that. Like I said, emotional intelligence is something that is not commonly taught and different people may have different pieces of the puzzle.)

So, picking one starting point as any, I've gotten to realize that emotions per se are target-less. They do not have a target built-in about them, just like a hammer does not. They have *preferential* targets, sure, but they don't come with one. Just like a person can be angry because of something or someone but they can still lash that anger at anything that's provoking enough.

In this sense, the phrase "being angry at/with someone" is profoundly misleading. The way that emotions end up having targets most of the time are more complicated constructs, such as resentment, where thoughts and emotions are coupled together: the memory of a slight, with the emotion that was generated at that moment stapled on top of that thought for posterity.

In the same manner, a lot of emotions end up tangled with the thoughts about a moment in time, an event, an experience, and are left there, not knowing how to be dealt with, or even believing that they are best left there, for whatever reason (such as eg. keeping tabs, waiting for revenge, etc).

The problem is that this runs counter to the more natural behaviours of emotions. Emotions are energies that are generated in the moment, and are best spent in that moment, which is the reason they came up in the first place. It is readily observable in animals, where they may act on a situation (like say, two members of a species breaking out into a fight as they meet), only to completely subside as soon as the moment passes (and moving on as if nothing happened). The energies come up to deal with the situation, the situation happens, and thus the energies are spent, the excess residues are discarded (such as geese shaking their wings after a scuffle), and life moves on.

Unsurprisingly enough, cases in which animals actually grow different behaviours in relation to emotions are most readily available in domesticated species, and the more in contact with exclusively humans, the more evident.

> Resentment is like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die.
 - Malachy McCourt

Emotions are energy that is sequestered to take a particular shape that fits the moment they are generated from. By stowing them away, and then repressing them afterward, we deprive ourselves of that energy, and effectively change the composition of our being, until they are actually allowed to come out and be processed. The most severe cases of emotions being not expressed, and thus repressed, about an event, are commonly named trauma.

In particular, such changes to our composition most readily show as mental issues, such as fears, intrusive voices, homicidal or suicidal thoughts, phobias, PTSD, anxiety, depression, and on towards even more than that.  
It has been by now shown in multiple studies that emotions are tied to physical health, and not just mental health. In particular, depression and anxiety are the most observed culprits, but from my observations, any emotion that is repressed lingers, and festers, and causes decreased functioning of the system. It is bearable in small amounts, but very often those that don't know how to deal with 1 don't know how to deal with 20, and so it piles up and eventually manifesting through mental disturbances, up to psychosomatic effects.

The default state of being is a relaxed attentiveness, being neutral and at peace with oneself, and it is readily apparent that many do not enjoy such a condition; and as much as many fingers can be pointed wrt the cause of that, I would say that emotional intelligence (or emotional self-mastery, as it could be titled) is one of the, if not *the* main component to reaching inner peace.

Emotions are the drive to sudden action that would pull us away from that neutrality; once spent, that energy is spent, or reunited to the main reservoir of neutrality. In case they remain, they pollute the scape with their presence until their energy is spent, or converted. Some people have gotten used to living with their anger, with their hate, or have learned to work around their fears and their anxieties, but to me this is the product of a society that is profoundly ignorant at large when emotions are concerned.

The reason many are not in that state is primarily because many have not learned how to deal with traumatic events, or even the little disturbances of life, in a healthy way. The emotions that they felt appropriate to summon in the moment to deal with the pain get sequestered, and with that, the pain also gets removed, for a while. The issue is that it goes nowhere; it remains in the system, and it remains as pain and emotions, and with them, the unwillingness to deal with this pain, even as they act as part of themselves, and seek more pain to accumulate, to self-perpetuate, as it is the nature of the ego to self-perpetuate, and this includes those parts of itself that are lodged in like past pain.

Self-perpetuation and self-preservations are natural behaviours of the ego-personality, given that the environment demands survival, especially the ancestral one; the issue arises when it starts to identify with stuff like stowed emotions, and when there's no cognition as to how to peacefully purge the system of them.

Through active self-preservation such emotions and thoughts become routine, worn grooves, that end up shaping the next events, the next thoughts, so that we become easily angered, or distrustful of everyone, or conditioned towards panic attacks, or depressed from any event, even for no apparent reason. As long as the stored emotional energy remains, there is a reason for this behavior to exists: it layers present pain on top of the past pain, so that the past pain is more hidden, and more part of a growing aggregate.

This ends up manifesting at every level, leaking into events from the intrusive thoughts to the full-bore experiences such as panic attacks.

But for example, you don't need to hold on to any emotions in order to act towards someone; if they merit it, you can do it from a completely still state, where all emotions have already come and gone. None of it is required, none of it has to be saved for posterity.  
In fact, processing events is a construct born out of the holding onto those emotions in the first place!

As soon as one would allow themselves to just feel nonjudgmentally the emotions tied with an event, and let them be, and maybe pass, and maybe transform, then their energy be reappropriated, that would be, almost by definition, be processed already.

This is basically what therapists hope to achieve when they prod people to revisit traumatic events, as unsuccessful as that manages to be within that framework.
Just telling someone to revisit an event doesn't free them from the constructs of blame, of guilt, of thinking that something should be done about it in general, that make them feel obligated to hold on to those emotions until indeterminate future date, and so that solves nothing.
To bear, there are plenty more successful psychotherapy frameworks from which to process past trauma/stuck emotions, such as Hakomi, or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, to name two.

And besides, just because an emotion is tied to a past event, doesn't mean that event has to be revisited for the emotions to come forward, as it is clearly shown by those expressions of the repressed emotion (say: rage fits) that cannot be traced immediately to the event that they are connected to.

To reiterate, stuck emotions are a completely fucked up concept that we somehow take for granted in this society, and lucky are the ones that don't pick up on it, or better, move past it.

## About the cure

So how do we move past this paradigm? 
To date, what I found works best is a series of interrelated concepts:

awareness/consciousness

equanimity: the openness of reception without judgment of what comes

understanding of self: from that observation and reception, comes the realization of how things are deep within, including the realization of self as individuated consciousness, and not anything like the mind or the body etc.

acceptance: the coming to accept that things are just as they are, and no different; the surrendering to what is, right now, including the way we perceive the past and the way we perceive the future. Observance is acceptance, looking at things is in a sense accepting that they are the way they are right now.

self-love (for lack of a more direct term): from those basis of understanding and acceptance, the knowing that you are still valid, just the way you are. That no matter how much your life is a mess, you are always capable of love; that as long as you are capable of expressing support and love and helpfulness to someone, that someone can be you; you are not seeing yourself from the outside, and thus you are also burdened by all the emotional baggage you have accumulated from the way; but if you did look at yourself from the outside, you would still realize that it doesn't diminish your worth, which is innate; and now you know that you can treat those and dissolve those spikes you keep around, those corners you keep around that you keep bumping in

also, definition of pain:
Resentment, hatred, self-pity, guilt, anger, depression, jealousy, and so on, even the slightest irritation, are all forms of pain. 
These are all forms of expression that fuel our suffering, and in particular poison ourselves from the inside if suppressed, and so, the two steps are not generating those anymore in the present, and dealing with the past accumulated pain.

the pain such as from physical etc. will be called present pain, since that happens exclusively in the present, and doesn't exist anywhere else, and isn't about anything else than the present.

### the part of not generating any more pain,

Pain is generated in the present by reacting to events as if they were to threats to ourselves. The ego-personality can contain many such reactive behaviours, which summon emotions such as anger or fear that are supposed to guide our behaviour in the encounter.

If those thoughts are not given weight, the emotions do not arise as response. So what one can do is awareness of thoughts and realizing that they can be ignored, even when they cry wolf

On the other hand, if the emotions have already been evoked, one can become aware of them, and do their best to express them in the most nurturing way possible. Honesty is usually an incredibly liberating policy on the matter, especially if nonjudgmental and not recriminative (so eg. pointing out that something made you angry, rather than saying it was offensive. It is about not placing blame on anything, because that only perpetuates pain)

Venting the pain conventionally, such as lashing out when anger, often leads to generating more pain, be it because of hurting someone, and receiving more pain for your troubles, or from feelings of guilt, inadequacy, concern etc. that follow such outbursts. It is pain seeking pain, and it can do this reliably if left to its own devices.

when you allow yourself to feel, you are in the capacity to choose the expression, you are present, and you can still act in the way that the moment demands (possibly in nurturance of life)

if you don't get called to intervene you will not generate any emotional charge, and so you're done
if you are called, then use the emotion you generate, spend it in the moment. Either feel compelled to act and act, or realize that things don't need to be changed, and stay
realize that it starts with the thoughts and the resistance of the present, and observe the former, and dissolve the latter

it's about observing the thoughts and realizing they are not you, that you are not called to act on them, you can let them pass. This is something that meditation helps immensely with, precisely because it provides a space in which one is expected not to act on any thought in particular.

### and the part of dealing with the past pain

Emotions that are repressed accumulate within the body, and together they form a composite called the pain body.
The pain body is the gestalt of the repressed emotions and the connected thoughts, that lay dormant some of the time, offer mild interference most of the time, and actually "awaken" and act out on occasion. Ehe ego can learn to identify with those emotions and thoughts as they surface and manifest, and so move to perpetuate them, becoming pain seeking pain, even as the person perpetuating the pain doesn't realize why they are doing it, what part of themselves it is coming from.

The ego runs away from the past pain, and in doing so allows it to remain undisturbed, and when it inevitably manifests again, the ego is unable to distinguish it as non-self and nurtures it with more pain. The pain seeking pain perpetuates the cycle of unconsciousness, of not daring to look into the past wounds as they get piled up with new ones.

Think of every time you had something to say, and felt intimidated by the situation, and chose not to, and felt bad about it. This feeling bad gets stored, and it has become guilt, and every time a similar situation repeats, this guilt comes up again, and creates further attrition against action. It then becomes guilt piled on more guilt, and each time makes it more difficult to speak up.
It becomes stuck patterns, and eventually part of one's very sense of identity, like "the shy person without the courage to speak up."

so it's about intending to stop these cycles, and putting the actual stop to them, by becoming aware of them, and letting something take their course, transmuting something, and just becoming fully aware of something else, as the moment will guide you to.

reminder that the mind runs away from the pain, and it can be read as a mechanism for survival, but we've taking thism mechanism and misapplying it, and this is a problem because this pain has to be faced, witnessed, understood, and transformed.

this can happen when we try and run away from the pain, and the pain becomes our shadow
and when it surfaces in ways that aren't quite ourselves, and we end up doing things that go counter to our usual objectives, causing more suffering in ourselves and others
those patterns have become part of ourselves and self-perpetuate, and need adjustment

it can become very frustrating to see oneself ruin things in our hands, and not understanding what we're doing wrong, reaching levels of loss of hope etc. but instead of retreating further into self-judgment, self-commiseration and self-recrimination, it is heavily suggested to instead become fully aware of ourselves, since it can be much easier than expected to just put the spotlight to the parts of ourselves that are responsible. They come from pain, that we are used to look away from, so as soon as we don't look away from the pain, things are offered quite readily.

What I've found is that base nonjudgmental awareness (observance of emotions, without act, without blaming, and with the knowing that those emotions have intrinsically no target, unlike thoughts), united with at least a base acknowledgment of the transformative properties of consciousness, is what allows emotions to be transmuted in the most elementary and wide-ranging effective manner.

The light of awareness, of consciousness, is deeply effective, and just observing something fully and let it transform before you can be enough.

#### Meditation

Reminder that the mind will keep trying to run away from the pain, to the point that it may prefer suicide to feeling the pain, paradoxically, and instead, it's tine to grab the reins away from the thoughts and their incessant chatter, and instead observe, and take the attention to the body, where it's easier to perceive emotions as located in teh body, and expecially the inner body.

instead of those usual mind patterns, acceptance, forgiveness, presence, consciousness, understanding, identification

this can be trained in awareness meditation (with the acknowledgment that when those disturbances, those charged thoughts, those annoyances pop up, it is a good thing! That is the start of the healing process), as in a dedicated space of observation, non-action and non-judgment
called equanimity

really the pillars of jhana: inner focus, still mind, and equanimity

inner focus: focus on inner body
still mind: no judgment, no thoughts about it, no labels, let it exist and change and shift and just exist without bad or good involved
equanimity: neutral openness to receive all, and go as deep and painful as it pleases, let the healing take place, and observe

so really, the light of consciousness is quite enough in and of itself to transmute those emotions, or at least to make you aware enough of them that they can be transmuted in the right setting; the trick is in knowing that they can be dealt at all in this manner, and cured

always can be the observer, always can be conscious

I've seen far too many people run into the misconception that mediation is done by clearing the mind. This is by and large unproductive. This is like saying that a marathon is done by reaching the finish line of the track. It misplaces the fundamental act of meditation with is applying nonjudgmental awareness, much like the fundamental act of a marathon is the actual running. This misconception is of course a continuation of the framework of emotions as something that just linger, and that have to just be suppressed again to deal with life until the proper time is right, or maybe even never.

#### Some specific techniques

the vulnerability is what keeps the emotions raw and present, the motive for their presence.
Vulnerability is really important for it's what draws the whole thing out (the ego despises feeling vulnerable, and it's everything it vows to hide) and it's what the pain is about in the first place, so keeping awareness of the vulnerability maintains their presence

it's useful sometimes to think of this pain acting and not creating more pain, discharing itself through other forms of behaviour
so this is about the channeling but it can also take place in mental excercises, although it can take some mental discipline
it's having them act in nurturing ways as expression of that pain, which will still be an expenditure
a device i've employed for the purpose are white gloves (you know the saying? treating with white gloves?) that transform the energies from violent and aggressive to nurturing and caring acts, it's a bit of a crutch I use when I don't manage to change some energies' expressions other ways, so I use this instead for a more direct and intensive approach

also tulpaforcing of self, incredibly useful self-debugging tool (w/link)

also nonjudgmental exhamination, just being brutally honest and without placing any blame (especially towards people), explaining fully the why of things can also work, keep it at an internal explanation level. Things outside have caused distress, and then what happened inside is the real culprit, because pain is not 
brutal honesty with nonjudgment is a good way of letting those emotions flow and the exhamination can straighten up things
just remember to stay conscious and aware
it helps if there's someone to listen to that you can confide the stuff to, without being judged
it can be a close friend, it can be a rubber duck, it can be the Universe itself

### Afterwards

Sometimes mere continued awareness of your emotions can transform them
allow yourself to express what comes that's positive, liberating, 
laughter is often a relief and a transformer, it's a good way to free yourself of the old energies
and also to push the boundaries! As you become even just semi-comfortable with laughing in the face of that pain, you become much more comfortable with just being in its presence.

if that's not enough, bring yourself to a similar scene, or mind scenario, or recall the part, and remember the pain seeking pain, and instead act from a new intelligence. Speak up, act with the intention of doing the right thing, and just that. Reduce to the essence of the matter, and act on just that.
similar situations, some things may only come out in specific circumstances in their full form
it's important to maintain vulnerability as base; the core is the refusal to admit vulnerability
that said, with the concept of vulnerability, also act to defend it, in neutrality; it's just acting against unconsciousness; unconsciousness in you that would generate more pain, and unconsciousness in others that would do the same. Act against unconsciousness, and only that.

Flowering of new behaviours, allow yourself to be yourself, to be vulnerable, to be weird and original and you, and loving, and open and receptive, defend this expression in yourself and others, expose, let it come out and express itself, that thing you've kept hidden for so long because you've been fearing what others would say, let it come out, it doesn't have to be anything super showy, it can be something unassuming as long as it's you, that part of you that is pushing from deep within to find honest expression

and it's about understanding, reappropriating the self, and moving on, opening to life, being vulnerable, accepting the past pain, letting past things transmute, and no judgment no labels etc.

in the moment, realization that you're exposing yourself in a manner that had you burnt before. Making yourself vulnerable. Being aware of the pain, so that you can move on. Listening to something else, more intuitive, and acting as the moment offers, if you're to run away, then you do; if you're to put yourself in there, then you do
together with the pain, draw from new wisdom, it's not about the stuff of rules or morals
and it's about putting yourself out there again with the added wisdom really. Have it teach you where to draw from, have it push you into awareness, into wakefulness, into consciousness, because that's what saves you, that's what forces you to look in the right direction

catharsis as catalyist, pantomime, imagine someone close, imagine speaking to someone
and mirroring, putting yourself in others' shoes etc.

also observing reactions, and with your consciousness, gaining more awareness, can realize that you can act different from those, you can change how to react, or better yet, you can drop reactions and just be present to act

There are many ways to go about it, but expanded awareness remains at the core of all of them, so practice that first and foremost.

### Practice self-love explicitly

Really this cannot be overstressed, how love of self helps to right so much

understanding of self, forgiveness of self,
metta
and cultivation of acceptance and awareness in the daily

## AS FURTHER THINKING
all those emotions are borne out of the sense of separation with others
to cure them, remove the belief of separation

awareness and breath

and this 

each situation that summons the past pain can be an occasion to go beyond, to transmute, to act differently this time, to dispel the demons of the past, to grow vulnerable and spontaneous once again, to re-set the wounds, and find a new expression, or perhaps just an expression forgotten, and heal.

but we can make it work
we can nurture life
we can let the energy flower
we can learn and we can grow, and we can become even something more than the past, and we can do it together

liberation, unlimiting, transformation, opening, expression, vulnerability, new intelligence inside you called to act from stillness

meditation
be in that place and feel the most obvious thing in that moment when under that feeling
the unatterable aspirations of your human soul
and hold them 
and trust them
obvious, intuitive, raw, absolutely obvious, driven from the unity, the connection, the oneness, the paradigm
once you operate from the paradigm it's just the most obvious thing from that place
love is the most obvious and natural thing, as I recall telling myself in that one tantric massage session
