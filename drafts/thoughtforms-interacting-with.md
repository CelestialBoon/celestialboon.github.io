guide them to realization that it is all the self.
Oneness, equality, and truthfulness. INfinite beings. Sovereign Integrals.
all the one Mind and you're infinite beings in it
we are consciousnesses, presence of god, we are the gods of our local multiverse, and it is us. We are all One. And we interact in part through the Mind, which is a way of seeiing things, seeing separation so that we might reunite the parts into a new Oneness

the use of Metaphor to convey the direction. It is not lying because it is fiction wrapping the truth


Warning, this takes the meta view heavily

that fantasia 2000 part with mother nature holy shit

use tulpamancyyyyy as base? well whatever's best really, all techniques interact with thoughtforms and basically so every one of those has their place

- Working with thoughtforms (life as thoughtforms, mixing and matching various doctrines for maximum effect (tulpas, entities, spirits, etc))
All life as thoughtforms, from the least to the greatest. Configurations of consciousness shaped by energy. And really, anything that is thinkable is already a thoughform.
Plus, the sheer interconnectedness of all things
the interrelatedness of within and without to the point that they are one and the same (how you can exorcise demons by getting fit and cure illness by sucking out the bad energy)
So, within == without (also corroborated by r/holofractal theory etc.)
yeah in the sense that the without is accessible from within, and vice versa. It's this separation that falls because it's all thoughtforms anyway, interacting. Single level of reality. The outside becomes a mirror of the within. The within is outside (mental scape etc.) and the without is inside (remote viewing etc.)
AND the fractal nature of self-ness
and thus, one can approach from the two angles. More than that it gets useful to correlate, to use the two in tandem (much like summoning rituals in which circles on the ground are drawn but it takes place in the mental most often)
SO basically, given a base inventory of the differences between thoughtforms (like where they live and behaviours etc.) one can absolutely use the same methods to treat any of them. If it works on one it can work on another, within parameters
so that means, tulpaforcing, entity work, and shamanism, and spirit work in general are all interchangeable, or more aptly, can be integrated to function as a whole
examples here (like, communication, summoning, banishing, interaction with other forms, also egregores etc. )
also that tulpaforcing the self
and tulpaforcing from the heart
geez even putting this together coherently with examples is Something


some are established and might demend respect, or consistency, or a particular form of relationship, or of communication. Established pathways of interaction


the basis: refer to ontology in the other post?
but regardless, big theatre of consciousness
folded over until it is two observing one another

and like, this whole thoughtform-egregore-god thing,
the interprenation of concepts, into us, thoughtforms blending, there's no real separation from outside and inside, all is connected and there's just individuations of this connected whole, like one would take one point of the color wheel, and still, it would be connected to all other ones still

and all this, connectedness. Thinking of someone is kind of like having them close
in a sense that representation of your friend you have is connected with your friend, it's a two way street
like, it shows that when you think differently of someone you'll behave differently in their presence and their attitude will change accordingly. Same thing, but with less steps, more directly
and people might not notice this because we're trained to ignore this kind of thing, like they're tugging at your arm and you're distracted by something else

and like, you just interact. Their presence is something that's bigger or smaller depending on your resonance with it. The more you resonate the more stuff gets through, mmuch like it would work for oscillations, synchronized systems communicate more efficiently

and this whole, people keeping spirits for tulpas, so you can basically ask around, but yeah. It remains that 

And this whole. You don't have to keep every one close to your chest
there's people with populated, alive mindscapes or astral realms that go on on their own, that they don't consciously maintain. And all those characters, those thoughtforms there, are fine. You don't have to take them all in, that would be incredibly cramped and a suffering for everyone involved. Let them be. Go about and brighten their day if you like, but be aware that it's fine for them to be the place they are already.
And on a more 
Like, put this shit on a gradient. You can have them about and you can let them be elsewhere.
People all over
like, enjoy just calling up someone to chat with for a day. Or a regular visit to a shrine. There's people who do this all the time in their meditations, or in their hypnosis sessions, they just hang somewhere with someone in it.
You can have any sort of relationships with thoughtforms that you can think of, almost by definition.

and the techniques can be used across the board. You can like, create tulpas with energetic means. Or interact with spirits through tulpamancy techniques. They're all the same at the base. They are thoughtforms playing around the One Mind, and if it works for some, it can be made to work for others.
This includes the real big egregores, really any level. If it can be thought of it can be interacted with, and if it can be interacted with it exists

as within so without.
so all kinds of things are connected frominside to outside. Outside problems or spooks can be dealt inside. Inside problems can be dealt outsides
