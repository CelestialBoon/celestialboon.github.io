# Ecstasy and Shamanism

yeah, and you know all that fear when encountering the unknown? I think we've heavily misunderstood things here. It's just that this fear is part of ecstasy.

> We have already mentioned the importance of ecstasy for shamanism. Among early humans a preference for the intoxication experience was ensured simply because the experience was ecstatic. "Ecstatic" is a word central to my argument and preeminently worthy of further attention. It is a notion that is forced on us whenever we wish to indicate an experience or a state of mind that is cosmic in scale. An ecstatic experience transcends duality; it is simultaneously terrifying, hilarious, awe-inspiring, familiar, and bizarre. It is an experience that one wishes to have over and over again.

the sublimation of the energies of fear, the intermingling, the active transformation and mix and resulting elation

and shamanism
archaic techniques of ecstasy

so there's a lot of mckenna to put here
and how the plant world helps

losing oneself
dance, art, creativity
and all the techniques

and our search can be ascribed at least in part to the search for ecstasy, and our stumbling on the path, looking at the signposts and going the other way

## Fear, pain and ecstasy
and it's like, that fear is actually a sign you're going in the right direction
something to embrace with open arms and to exhilarate oneself with

like, as a society, we're really far, far removed from the acceptance of ecstasy
much less proper knowledge and use of it
like, basic example, you know how people fearing getting caught have spicier, more satisfying sex?
or how in general fear/pain can enhance sex, see: BDSM (strong sensation, power of language, they needed different words to recontextualize something that was useful to them, out of the stigma of the previous vocabulary) THe pain they feel is different because they contextualize it differently, and they use it, they accompany it to elevate the pleasure instead of a signal to get out of there
or the whole concept of guilty pleasure
or the taste of the forbidden
or personally how being in places where I'm not supposed to do something entices me to do that something
or all the extreme sports, and their inevitable component of fear, of adrenaline, of the deep pleasure from coming through to the other side of that fear. It's not just overcoming it and never having it again, it's encountering it again and again and *enjoying* it for exactly what it is

not only success is on the other side of discomfort, but exhilaration is on the other side of fear

this is also where the flagellation rites, or the whole shamanic practices of discomfort of various types, including self-harm, being stranded, and (partially) fasting come from

but when this is from ritual instead of psychedelic, this is when it's decadent

this is the proper completion of the ecstasy formula, mixing in the sublime with the scary
yeah, you can see it in a lot of places when you start looking
yeah, like in a lot of games the thrill of it is what keeps you coming back
which is the temporary experience of fear for something
it's the putting things on the line, like in competitive games, even if it's just the impression of it, as with virtual games, and that's why there's such a deep investment, the same mechanism is involved
it's something that's just part and parcel of a good time
and we've like, completely lost the formula for this kind of stuff
like, no wonder almost every person that I've scanned had their sacral chakra in poor condition

that's the ecstasy chakra, sexuality, creativity and personal power. How are those related? All three are accessed in ecstastic states 

and it's like, in our struggle to avoid the "bad" we've shut ourselves off also the "good", nevermind that you needed both anyway, that both cocreate the experiences we truly seek

all this time, the search for ecstasy

there's all these morals in popular media of going out there and just *living*, of taking life as it comes and enjoying it in the process, but it keeps clashing with our base assumption that there's something out there to avoid categorically, and that's just plain detrimental a belief
pain and pleasure both can catapult us to higher states, and indeed they can intermingle and heighten the sum experience
fear and excitement are the components of a truly deep and satisfying experience and this should be more widely recognized

and the whole tension and fear and danger that is the matter of the big interesting stories reflect this, the conflict that is the tension that brings growth, and the hero has always to face their fears, but the process is both instructive, liberating, and uplifting

like the spaz that goes "Let's do it again!"



the idea of the pained artist? Or how they can't get themselves to create when satisfied? That's a shadow that the concept of ecstasy is casting
Or how the procrastinators can only mobilize their creativity under severe fear of deadlines? That's also the mechanism of ecstasy
like, good god this is an enormous hole in the basic dictionary of concepts about ourselves
we've got people all round who just are completely oblivious of what the things that happen to them, mean to them
this is like, the worst case of teenage rebellion, as a species
(tho I say worst half-jokingly here, to clarify)
like, when I started the journey to know myself I didn't really expect that I was missing so much of the fucking bare basics
like the whole structure I had in place was maybe not upside-down, but tilted a good 90 degrees
like, god. This is what the resurgence is about, it's about making people aware of themselves, in those deep, core ways


## Boundary dissolution
at the end of the day, it's about dissolution of boundaries
mckenna quote would be good here on that subject
and ecstasy is one of the main carrier roads to that place

Chroma
nods I intuit some of this, but don't think I've realized much, or been so very conscious of it. I sort of stumble around...
What might a shaman do to help such a person?
or is it a question of balance, like, people have this but not in the right places or ways?

CelestialBoon
honestly? boundary dissolution would be the first thing. Be it entheogens, be it ritual dancing, be it any sort of trance that makes them lose themselves in ecstasy
even hypnosis done right is just that, boundary dissolution in the realms of ecstasy
and it's something basically everyone is looking for while not recognizing it when they meet it, most of the time
you gotta reacquaint people with the Mystery, with what they have lost so long ago
you gotta give them permission to fear, to get hurt, to roll in the mud, to lose themselves
because that's a vital component of ecstasy


## The Shaman
Shaman as the clever fella, the one who has seen behind the veil, the one that walks between both sides of reality, and possesses them both

like, this is what a Shaman is about. The shaman is about living in a world that makes sense, even if it's just deeply personal. It's about having proper relationship with the spirit world, about being practiced in ecstasy. I've heard from McKenna that the biggest part of shamanic training had to be mnemonic training, since that's how you get to carry back stuff from the other side

> ... the neophyte shaman undergoes a symbolic death and resurrection, which is understood as a radical transformation into a superhuman condition. Henceforth, the shaman has access to the superhuman plane, is a master of ecstasy, can travel in the spirit realm at will, and most important, can cure and divine.  
> As we noted in The Invisible Landscape: 
>
> In short, the shaman is transformed from a profane into a sacred state of being. Not only has he effected his own cure through this mystical transmutation, he is now invested with the power of the sacred, and hence can cure others as well. It is of the first order of importance to remember this, that the shaman is more than merely a sick man, or a madman; he is a sick man who has healed himself, who is cured, and who must shamanize in order to remain cured.

time itself is memory
you could say that different states of consciousness are partly defined by what field of intelligence, what memory, you have access to
well, I'd say that detail is a function of attention, in the sense that attention is what engages the senses, and memory is the practice of taking these impressions and indexing them properly

shamanism is the first, oldest, and longest-standing religion of all
it's the primordial, systematized relationship with the Divine
They've had hundreds of thousands of years to refine it, and in the presence of the real stuff too
not some dreary priests going off a book

Chroma
nods that seems to be a kind of entropy that creeps in if the essence or spirit of things takes second seat to other influences..

CelestialBoon
yeah, to the ego

Chroma
nod

CelestialBoon
and its style of domination

Chroma
*curls up* so it goes. I'm glad we're rediscovering these spiritual roots

CelestialBoon
like, you can read it plain as day, even western society as a whole is a massive ego trip
yeah, I'm very glad too.

the shaman as the precursor of the artist, the one that brings from the other side, the side of creativity and novelty and ideas and inspiration and imagination




--------------------------
Chroma
I've been a bit all over the place in terms of how I've been feeling generally, but I think I'm getting more comfortable. I'd like to make a space and time to work on my body (exercise), reconnect with myself (meditate), and I've been better at coming up with excuses to not (although admittedly they're p good ones with long days, many small projects, and I know I'll get there to the point where I make some time to just live)

CelestialBoon
well, all things in time and as needs get felt, hah
I think a crucial thing to understand is that exercise actually gives one energy, instead of depleting it
and meditation can stem from more of this desire to just be present here now, and once that desire's there, you can just be at any time
even if it's so uncomfortable sometimes to do that, and I think that's another of those pathologies of our collective self that we're here to heal, to rectify
like, it starts with knowing that this is less The Way You're Built, or The Way It Should Be, and just more of a resonance with the collective habit
that one would have to undo through practice, replacing a habit with another

Chroma
mmm

CelestialBoon
like, effectively we're as a species, addicted to unconsciousness. Lol
we tend to be there and it's a bit scary when we get out
and, well, that's another thing

Chroma
I'm very cautious about how I want to say some of these things, like, I don't want to be in some modality of "if only I had x, then I would be happy, but it's definitely true I would like to optimize my life here a bit so that I'm performing my best at work and also flourishing in the right ways in this new situation, and I'm sort of thinking about how to thread that needle.

CelestialBoon
yeah there's a lot of, this moment is exactly as it should be for me, it's perfect in the sense that it allows me the most flourishing growth

Chroma
but yeah, also, still catching myself caught up in some past moment or future anxiety, and continually have to be mindful of whether or not I'm truly in the present
from time to time, but a lot of ... just being present, too
and not experiencing stress, or impatience, or a lot of negative aspects of being caught up in something not-now
meeting a lot of people after a long period of isolation is a little overwhelming XD

CelestialBoon
yeah, and you know all that fear when encountering the unknown? I think we've heavily misunderstood things here. It's just that this fear is part of ecstasy. Lemme fetch a quote

Chroma
mmmm

nods it sort of makes sense, I think some things are comparable to it.
Urban Exploration was like that, part of the thrill was the game of not being caught XD

yeah, like in a lot of games the thrill of it is what keeps you coming back

Chroma
mmm
I've done a lot of both, maybe I'm better off than some XD
but i'm not sure it impacts my day-to-day

CelestialBoon
and it's something basically everyone is looking for while not recognizing it when they meet it, most of the time
you gotta reacquaint people with the Mystery, with what they have lost so long ago

Chroma
oh interesting
well, that makes sense

CelestialBoon

the neophyte shaman undergoes a symbolic death and resurrection, which is understood as a radical transformation into a superhuman condition. Henceforth, the shaman has access to the superhuman plane, is a master of ecstasy, can travel in the spirit realm at will, and most important, can cure and divine. 
As we noted in The Invisible Landscape: 

In short, the shaman is transformed from a profane into a sacred state of being. Not only has he effected his own cure through this mystical transmutation, he is now invested with the power of the sacred, and hence can cure others as well. It is of the first order of importance to remember this, that the shaman is more than merely a sick man, or a madman; he is a sick man who has healed himself, who is cured, and who must shamanize in order to remain cured.' 


Chroma
memory is a funny thing... it seems, for me at least, a function of attention

CelestialBoon
time itself is memory
you could say that different states of consciousness are partly defined by what field of intelligence, what memory, you have access to
well, I'd say that detail is a function of attention, in the sense that attention is what engages the senses, and memory is the practice of taking these impressions and indexing them properly

Chroma
yeah
and so being present to observe the event is one important part of that XD

CelestialBoon
mhm

Chroma
I would histoically have social anxiety in the presence of new people, and inevitably remember the wrong things and fail to recollect the essential ones XD what a basketcase
i've got to get to bed soon, but

CelestialBoon
oh yeah like, I've got no shortage of this kind of things myself, times where I could just see myself doing things in all the wrong ways

Chroma
i'm excited to hear more from this shamanistic point of view, it's interesting stuff, like chaos magick XD seems pragmatic and real
but yeah

CelestialBoon
it's the first, oldest, and longest-standing religion of all

Chroma
nods

CelestialBoon
it's the primordial, systematized relationship with the Divine
They've had hundreds of thousands of years to refine it, and in the presence of the real stuff too
not some dreary priests going off a book

Chroma
those guys seem a bit more .... political ... than this stuff n__n
mmm
be well, ni nite

CelestialBoon
yeah, the religion in India is a very special case of this, it's this religion that's completely hollowed out and has become just a caste system and rules over rules
good night.

Chroma
nods that seems to be a kind of entropy that creeps in if the essence or spirit of things takes second seat to other influences..

CelestialBoon
yeah, to the ego

Chroma
nod

CelestialBoon
and its style of domination

Chroma
*curls up* so it goes. I'm glad we're rediscovering these spiritual roots

CelestialBoon
like, you can read it plain as day, even western society as a whole is a massive ego trip
yeah, I'm very glad too.

Chroma
purrs take care now falls asleep

CelestialBoon
be well, Creator.
I'm just gonna leave this here because I need a place where to assemble those insights but
the idea of the pained artist? Or how they can't get themselves to create when satisfied? That's a shadow that the concept of ecstasy is casting
