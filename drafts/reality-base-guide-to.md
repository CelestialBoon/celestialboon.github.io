base explanations of reality
	the guide
	maybe something that comes close enough, tho that will take some searching (probably that fringde naaaahhh)

by no means complete, by no means completely explanatory of everything, and by no means absolutely or completely correct. It is purely my vision and intepretation of things from my experiences and contemplations

One Woleness
gradients and difference and the mind creating barriers, separation, duality

there is a distinction to make here between difference and separation
take a color gradient, or a color wheel at that. One color blends into the other, but all movements to call this or that portion blue or red or white are completely arbitrary, as shown by the possibility of there being differences of opinion on where the boundaries are.

if you meditate on the boundaries of an object you might find it boundaryless

Separation, categorization, boxing are concepts of the mind. The mind works in duality and separation.
While instead, the reality of things is of wholeness, and gradients, and simply difference without any hard boundaries or fixed things. It is a transformation so utter as to not permit names.

plato can fuck off with his realm of ideals tbh
the nature of reality is transformation and impermanence
ideals have no part in that
the realm of ideals is literally the greatest philosophical wanking of the mind in its efforts to categorize everything
the mind categorizes, the mind names, the mind separates, the mind distinguishes
when you have a color wheel you can name colors but that doesn't mean that you're actually pointing at something discrete. It's all a single gradient. There's only wholeness there
the only separation is what the mind sees in there
the mind is the creator of duality
when there is only wholeness to see
wholeness is made of difference and gradients, but it is the mind that creates arbitrary barriers just to make sense of things

if I may interject with my vision

A principle that has served me excellently is `As within, so without.` What is inside is also outside. What is outside is also inside. If it's real to you, it's real in some tangible way, and vice versa. There is really only one reality and all we do is peer into it with different lenses, through different states of consciousness.

In a lot of occult circles, when one speaks of energy manipulation, it is often prefaced with subtle. Subtle energies. They are basically energy (so still basically expressions of movement and change in reality) that can be perceived, manipulated, shaped, and can have an effect on the other kinds of energy, the more physical ones (that is, common energy and matter)

This is in line with what physicists have observed about dark energy. It is a form of energy that exists, and is observable through gravitational lensing (ie. it has basically mass) but does not interact with physical reality in other common ways (eg. does not intercept ordinary light usually, and interprenates physical matter).

So what I'm saying is that energy work is, by and large, the perception and manipulation of dark energy.

At the very basis of things, everything in existence is vibrations, either trasverse or longitudinal. Primal light and sound. And from the patterns of interference between the primal vibrations, all the variations and combinations and intricaties that we call reality are born. 

There are takes on intelligent energy and information to give but I really gotta take the time organize that into more coherent words first.

Which really goes to show I gotta get my shit together and write a proper post about this sometime



so what are we teaching basically? the foundations to interact with the world as thoughtforms, and to use energy, and to use Love.


- Theory basics of the foundations (energy consciousness and thoughtforms etc.)
everything as vibration. Para Vach. Primordial Light and Sound. Everything as one field of oscillation/propagation. Holographic Universe of interprenation and connectedness. Source Intelligence/Aether. Possibly integration with Gateway PDF stuff. (which says that? well vibration, resonance, how the brain works, how consciousness perceives, and other goodies)
MEST + stuff from outside (Soul etc.) (the various levels of existence, sub-quantum etc. the Para Vach Image)
energy and consciousness as yin-yang (electromagnetic)

all is vibration. Consciousness perceives energy, and energy generates consciousness. also reread gateway holy shit

The changes to the Sixth Sense server revolve around a core ontology, that has shaped the efforts. While it is not meant to be taken as absolute truth, nonetheless it is the result of personal careful explorations, and is my own working model.

<br>


As first point, there is the concept of the world of form, of appearances, as maya, the ongoing creation of the One Mind, which is individuated into separate points of view.

It follows that all things, all beings are thoughtforms, and are inherently alive, since all is One, and that One is very much alive. Ergo, animism.
The focus on shamanism and tulpamancy springs from the desire to provide tools to explore this angle, this shape of Creation, that I've found working best. 

<br>

The second point would be that consciousness is the true composition of the Self.

The Self is, first and foremost, an individuated consciousness; it is the consciousness of the One Creator that has been cast into multiple points of view that each of us are. By the process of being conscious of things, such consciousnesses effectively create reality as observed.
It follows that particular focus should be placed on studying, examining such consciousness, and ways of altering it, for it effectively is what creates reality. From this reason comes the creation of channels dedicated to meditation, and entheogens, and other such ways of altering and observing diversified states of consciousness.

<br>

The third point would be the natural tendency of the Universe towards complexification, unification, compression of information. Terence McKenna called it novelty, and the tendency towards concrescence.

It is also astractable as the tendency of all separate expressions to reunite with the unitary consciousness of the One Creator. It is observable in the motion of the Universe from energy to atoms to molecules to cells to multicellular beings to ecosystems to societies, and this is still ongoing of course. Greater and greater complexity, unification, connection.

This motion is guided by a force, the unification force, that pervades all of Creation, through the distributed presence of the pure consciousness of the One Creator inside of Its creation. It is what some call the Holy Spirit, or Source Intelligence, or Intelligent Infinity, or the Aether, or the quantum vacuum, or zero-point energy field; really, there's plenty of names for it.

And this force is of course, harnessable. One can align to this motion of the Universe and channel such force through one's being and actions. The best way I've heard it described is in the Wingmakers materials, under the name of Divine Love.

As much as the name would imply otherwise, it is a force that transcends good and evil, and ultimately acts towards understanding of the disparate parts and their confluence into a common synthesis. It is the reunification of the dualities into a new unity.

More in general, this movement causes expansion of consciousness, which is the actual end-goal of things. Through the accumulation of experiences and distillation of wisdom, and the reunion of the disparate evolved viewpoints into the Whole, the One Creator allows Itself to grow and expand Its personality.

In particular, the Wingmakers materials is what I've found describing all this in the most clarifying manner, not only through straight philosophy, but also providing experiential frameworks, and media that is designed to be catalyzing, allowing the careful student of such materials to rapidly shift their consciousness into awareness of their greater Self.
