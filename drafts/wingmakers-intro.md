and the catalysis
and what they're shooting for

Alright.

The material I refer to is collectively referred to as the Wingmakers Materials; it is a coherent set of paintings, music, poetry, novels, philosophy and just plain instructional papers and other things that is designed to be both instructive and catalytic, in the sense that it brings changes at a subtle level through immersion, study and/or contemplation.

It's a whole lot, honestly. The usual starting point (taking the site as reference) would be either the Neruda interviews or the Ancient Arrow Project book (one is in Content -> Neruda interviews, the other in the Dropbox folder under Books) for the conspiracy-oriented, or the whole painting-music-poetry ensemble for the artistically inclined, or there's plenty of philosophy (content -> philosophy) and dialectical teachings (the Lyricus discourses, under content -> resources) for the ones willing to dive into the concepts and get to the reality of things.

After that, there's the whole living from the Heart thing, and that's the 6 Heart Virtues tab on the site, or the EVT folder inside Dropbox. That is basically the core teachings as far as living from the Heart is concerned, containing the techniques, the paradigms, the information necessary to produce and sustain divine Love in the daily life. If you're to snoop there I suggest beginning with The Art of the Genuine.
