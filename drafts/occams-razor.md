and the occam's razor
	explained to cadey
	ever noticed how Occam's Razor is a tool to simply reaffirm beliefs, and not to update them? Whatever explanation is closest to your existing beliefs is inherently classified as simpler
	that it's terrible because it's just a tool to reaffirm your own beliefs
	like God did it is a very simple explanation and it covers everything neatly, done
	it is a tool that is heavily biased by your priors, and as such it will distort your vision of the world whenever you use it, biasing you towards conservativism
	which is very much sympthomatic of a larger problem in science of the inability to approach what sits outside the current paradigm of materialism
	to the point that the simple putting together of relativity and quantum mechanics has been abruptly stopped just because we couldn't accept the inherent results that would stem for it because it would put the world upside down
	but it's breaking down as of recently, more and more people are realizing that matter is an illusion, that it's just patterns, shifting and ephemeral and yet made of unperishable energy
	but that's a tale for another time

As useful as Occam's Razor is as a quick, problem-solving heuristic, it is woefully inadequate as a comprehensive tool to increase knowledge.

There's no way to classify, to quantify assumptions, we are in the land of priors. If you are going to challenge your priors, Occam is not the tool to do it because it is severely based on them.

At some point you might want to shift your priors (which is basically integration of the preexisting ones with the accumulated knowledge) and Occam is a tool that defends them

Because it discredits the new and the different. It is something designed to enforce the existing beliefs, as a way of making quick sense of things.

It is a tool of exploitation, and not exploration, and so we should really never pretend otherwise.

The example of God, that's just one assumption, it's in the priors so it's just there, lodged in conveniently, and no amount of Occam's is going to change the fact that God is the simplest explanation, just like a potter is the simplest explanation for a pot, if you have seen no machines doing any.
