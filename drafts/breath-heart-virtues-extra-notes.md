
appreciation:
recognize the creator's presence in self and others
develop the secret eye (TDP), the seventh sense, the seeing the woods with new eyes, the energetic one? that's the sixth sense

> Hugelitod had been a priest since he was a boy. Even as a young child his consuming dream was to serve God and His creation, as directed by God. His favorite rhyme growing up was given to him from a dream: All I truly wish to be is a purified channel of humility. He spoke this simple rhyme a thousand times each week, and did so for many years, until he found himself living and breathing the priesthood.

> Kamil looked in astonishment as a human form stood before him, looking just as he, composed of light and nothing more.  
> He could not resist reaching out and touching the body of light, but as he did, it receded, stepping backwards as if it were shy. A voice, that sounded uncannily familiar, filled his entire being. "You are my shadow. A shadow cannot initiate action, for you are the result of my deeds, my purpose, my desires, and my will. So as you reach for me, you will find that I am renascent, hidden in the perpetual birth of creation of which you are part, but always the transient effect. If you seek to know me, to touch my being and feel my presence, then you must be prepared for the transformation of your emptiness."

the invoking of soul
it's quite the baseline really

understanding:

valor:

the transparency, the openness, the defenselessness, the no-reservations, the allowing and nurturing the presence of love in self and others

> His sense of time faded away, and he was left with an utter silence, deafening to his mind. He began to recite something his mother had taught him: Fear will fail you, love will unveil you. He repeated it in his head over and over, and each time he brought his focus closer to his heart, imagining that love was beating there strong and clear.

live in your breath etc.
that whole, breathing through me

just grep breath ok
there is sooo much here

in general, breath is the very presence of soul (consciousness, love, vibration, VIBRATION)
and it carries the divine intelligence channeled from Source Intelligence


It's good stuff, works for all 6 heart virtues
Also I've noticed that it helps thinking them as intelligences as well, not just presences or feelings or frequencies
but powerful divine intelligence, condensed
