emotionally/energetically: metta

Appreciation: dance of the universe, gestures that nurture friendship
the chisel, the relationship with all, the connection

**Appreciation:**

At the subtle levels, this virtue is focused on a specific awareness that First Source surrounds our fellow beings as a field of consciousness and that this consciousness unifies us. If we are unified, it follows that we operate as a collective consciousness at some deeper level, and in this place, we share a common purpose that is richly textured, supremely vital, and yet mysterious, dynamic and uncertain. This awareness, or even belief, shifts our focus from the small details of our personal life to the vision of our purpose as a species.

At a more practical level, appreciation expresses itself in the small gestures of gratitude that support relationship loyalty and bonding. The deeper levels of appreciation make the relatively surface level expressions genuine because they stem from the frequencies of soul instead of the motives of the ego or mind.

think of how good you feel when someone eats the shit out of something you cooked and asks for more. that's so much better than thank you, right?  gratitude is loud, unforced, shared enjoyment. it's the only way to be thanked that actually feels good.

gratitude is indulging in the pleasure of noticing good things. when dad said "you take things for granted" he meant "cower on your belly for scraps," when i say it i mean "you're leaving pleasure on the table, you can feel good for free, it's right there, good shit, all yours"

Appreciation is a topic that I could maybe spend hours talking about, being one of the six heart virtues. It's a central pillar of behavioural virtue

It's not about just what you do, but how you do it. Eg. to drive is not enough; one would have to drive *well*, and drive *towards their destination*.

shared purpose, the game that we play together, working together, it makes sense to support other things because those things end up as goods in your life

The mental/emotional part is the concept/feeling of gratitude. I don't think there's much to explain here, if anything because 

What is appreciation? Of course, part of it is the feeling of gratitude, but the most prominent part is the action of *expressing* gratitude. And I think one way this is expressed is partly contained in the word "thanks" itself, but more clearly so in the italian counterpart, "grazie". Namely, both words contain meaning of delivering a blessing (much more clearly with the italian word, which would literally translate into "graces"). And I think that this is the core of appreciation: it is well-wishing, turned into action. Which makes sense, since if you do appreciate something, you would want it to do well and to succeed. You would wish nice things to happen to it, and part of this wish is to make it happen yourself.
Appreciation is being a good friend to sommeone; appreciation is giving a nice gift to someone; appreciation is also paying someone for their services, insofar as money stands as the usual metaphor for transfer of energy in potential.
Though of course, there's quite the lot of variation in significance even within those examples. Not all gifts are equal, and the same gesture can carry very different meaning within. Within this space of possibility, then, appreciation is showing that you care. We say that it's the thought that counts as far as gifts are concerned. What this means is, that it is less important how expensive the gift is, and more how impactful it is; how much it is tailored to the person being gifted. This tailoring is a result of knowing the person, of caring about the person, of paying attention to them. And this is the basis of true appreciation because love is the basis of true appreciation, and love is fundamentally consciousness, with attention being a primary aspect of consciousness.
As such, appreciation is the way that we pay back life for the gifts it delivers to us, by helping the things that we appreciate to bloom and flourish. It is an act both of self-interest and of outward-interest. It is the very direct manifestation of our feelings of gratitude by transmutating them into actions that directly support the object of our gratitude, even if this sometimes simply to bring more of that pattern into our lives. For example, appreciating meditation could be done simply by meditationg more often, or by learning to do it better. Like the other heart virtues, it is a simple, obvious thing when looked at in the face, but as they say, simplicity is the ultimate sophistication; I have spent quite a bit of time of guided contemplation and practice before reaching such an understanding of this virtue.



appreciation, gratitude, attention, consciousness

to start examining it, let's first go with the solve movement, splitting it into components

appreciation from the mental standpoint
gratitude as the feeling
what is the expression of gratitude called? xyxx

appreciation as giving price to things, the movement of giving/recognizing value in the things around you 
in a spirit/mind/body fashion or mercury/salt/sulphur, it's appreciation/gratitude/giving

gratitude is the simplest to describe, the warm fuzzy feeling in the chest of a thing that we like, and that we feel good about. It's THE feel good emotion, I think, as far as public recognition goes, probably

giving? the wingmakers definition blah blah
and already this says something, because it is a precise giving with a purpose
we find this purpose in the very act of giving thanks. In English thanks etimologically equates to giving good thoughts towards someone or something, but in italian grazie is used, and grazie means wishing graces on them

And it starts to click that well-wishing on something serves to make that thing last longer and last better. The giving serves to enrich, enbiggen, to enliven the target of our giving.
At the core, this is a mechanism that is shared by the simple giving of attention. When we give attention to something, that thing grows in our personal experience of reality. It takes more space, it takes on better detail, it becomes a more nuanced and rich experience by the mere act of resting/directing our attention there. Already this is an act of giving
and it is something that not only very precious to ourselves but also recognized as such by others: giving an ear to a friend, needing attention, the market of attention, etc.
So the giving is about anything that would foster, nurture, and enliven the target of our gratitude. But why would we do it?
The most obvious answer is, because it's somethting we like. If we like something, most likely we wish well for it, and we want more of it in our lives (even if not right now, but in some future time), and so the giving is aimed to ensure the presence of that thing in our future present, even in a richer and |better| fashion. 

but, there's many things that we can like in the moment, even things that are destructive to us, things that only give temporary relief and bring long-term consequences. Addictions are a rime example of behaviours that we focus on and they bring temporary pleasure and benefits for long-term damage annd misery. So how to choose? How to differentiate?

Then there's the spiritual/meaning component, enter the wingmakers definition
fundamentalthe concept of operating from a higer purpose
the connectedness of us all
things happen for a reason
things from the persepctive of your spirit, of life purpose, of acting from the spirit and not the body, which is directionless alone
doing the things that spirit wills somehow
appprecation as the appreciation for the universe, not uust things that please us but things that please us as us the whole
the faith seen as you can see it happening
seeing god in things
seeing the order of god in things
the perfection of being
appreciating even the little things
all that good things on the table, all that pleasure on the table for you to pick up
faith and purpose and meaning and belevolence
apprecation things from the precpective of a life arc, of a personal adventure story, as things that further your path, ush your narrative forward
and that are beautiful and fill your life with pleasurable harmony and joy
the concpt of a life direction, so that you put things in from ot you that further you in that direction
like beautiful good pleasurable things, so we apprecaite those because they create a reality for us that is good true beautiful and pleasurable. It's following our deep callings but at a pragmatic level that we create with our actions and our attention and our intention the world that we desire
and it starts with attention, insert visa tweet here on focus on the things you want to see more of in the world

1
Okay so, for the purposes of the *solve* of understanding, appreciation can be roughly discerned to have three components, even if they are profoundly intertwined and interacting:
- the mental component, of gratitude
- the emotional component, of metta
- the physical giving

2
mentally, let's start with the hint-definition that James gives of appreciation:
"At the subtle levels, this virtue is focused on a specific awareness that First Source surrounds our fellow beings as a field of consciousness and that this consciousness unifies us. ...

3
"... If we are unified, it follows that we operate as a collective consciousness at some deeper level, and in this place, we share a common purpose that is richly textured, supremely vital, and yet mysterious, dynamic and uncertain. ..."


4
"... This awareness, or even belief, shifts our focus from the small details of our personal life to the vision of our purpose as a species."

5
This covers the "why" of awareness as an outward expression. It expresses how we're all co-creating the fabric of our experience together. We're all instruments of the orchestra, we're all dancers on the stage, and gratitude invites to notice just how beautiful this dance is.

6
It's something that hits all our notes: it is alive, it is rich, it is mesmerizing, it is touching, it is unknowable, it is dynamic and responsive and so full of care and caring. The cosmic dance, within and without, is something we almost can't peel our eyes away from.

7
Mentally, gratitude stems from seeing God in the face, to so speak. To recognize personal experience and reality as the divine play of Lila, to contemplate it as such, to see it and feel it as such, and to interact with it as such, with this knowing.

8
Now, emotionally. Emotionally, I think metta is the closest signifier for the emotional/energetic expression of appreciation.

9
It's often closely related to the mental component, so much so that we end up saying "my heart fills with gratitude" and we feel the radiant glow of metta in our hearts. That warm, fuzzy glow of a wonderful Rightness, that flows and gives because it is entirely its nature to.

10
Metta as the divine flow of pure vibrations, the energetic flow of giving that doesn't know scarcity because it is abundance itself; it doesn't know hate because it is Love itself; and just as the Light doesn't know Shadow, metta doesn't know Wrong because it is Right itself.

1
The Love that God itself has for all beings, the love that courses through all of creation, the force that keeps all in motion, that is metta. That force is ours because it is us. It is what the Dream is made of, and we are It.

2
Of course, all the usual tools for accessing metta apply, including metta meditation. It's needless to say that the mental framework of gratitude helps wrt growing closer to metta, however it is summoned.

3
However, there are many degrees of intensity to which the force of metta can be felt, from the God-beam to the warm fuzzies. It is so endemic in our life that naturally it colonizes facets of our life both intense and mundane.

4
It's important to learn to recognize all these aspects of metta, for it is a force both powerful and immensely benevolent. In particular, bringing our focus of consciousness downward, especially in the heart region, is especially useful for perceiving and connecting with it.

5
(As a point of note, it's very useful in general if all our body stays aware of itself - if consciousness is activated in our whole body, especially as body-part-aware-of-itself, instead of the framework of the-head-being-aware-of-something-else.)

https://twitter.com/the_wilderless/status/1463115906494705667

6
(Doing so, among other things, allows a proper flow of energy in the body, which is crucial for metta, itself closely-related-to a flow of energy.)

7
This sort of appreciation-feeling can really come from all sources, and it is pretty much what people think it is, from feeling good from a welcome present from a friend, to feeling the beauty in a morning flower, to feeling happy and satisfied with what you've done.

https://twitter.com/saul_mondriaan/status/1595890650666319872

8
On a more mundane level, there's not a lot of surprises - you just scale down metta and find the simple appreciation for life, in all the usual flavors. Which, incidentally, can also serve as seed feelings in order to summon a more intense metta proper.

9
Now, on the more physical/behavioural plane, the closest word I can reference is giving. Let's take James' passage on it:
"At a more practical level, appreciation expresses itself in the small gestures of gratitude that support relationship loyalty and bonding."

20
This level is connected to the others since: "The deeper levels of appreciation make the relatively surface level expressions genuine because they stem from the frequencies of soul instead of the motives of the ego or mind."

1
And, at some level that feels obvious, right? We associate "expressing gratitude" with the act of heartfelt giving. Though it's worth to dig around a little more.

2
Let's start with the language of gratitude. "Thanks" has etymological roots in "good thinking", basically well-wishing. I think this hits deeper with the Italian variant, "grazie", literally translating to "graces", so wishing graces to befall the recipient.

3
And that opens up a path of understanding, because of course you would wish good things to happen to someone you are grateful for: if it's something that is a welcome presence in your life, you would wish it to do well, so that it keeps going and you have more of it, and better!

4
So on one hand, appreciation-giving is essentially a feedback mechanism. Appreciating something, you Give in order for that thing to grow and prosper, so that it also develops and gives you more of what you appreciate. It's a regulation mechanism, on some level.

5
And this goes many things in our life, from giving a friend something they like because you appreciate their presence in your life, and because this gift makes them happier and brighter still; or paying a service that you appreciate so that they keep running; ...

6
... or even giving your time and effort to a cause that you like being a part of.

This giving takes many forms, and indeed one could determine that all forms of interaction contain a portion of Giving for us, for we are always exchanging energies with the object of our focus.

7
This works both ways, and can be a boon to us as well as our ruin, for since it works in general, and that means that even the things we hate are something we are devoting energy and attention to, and they also grow from it.

https://twitter.com/dailyzen/status/700168010074624001

8
This leads to the moral imperative of focusing your own attention and efforts on the things that you want more of in your life, since that is the mechanism by which appreciation works. The more you feed something, the more it grows in your life.

https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1324978566455468035

9
And this goes for physical efforts, and emotional/energetic flows, but also most importantly for attention. Attention/focus of consciousness IS the main way that you get to determine the contents of your life. The more you look at something, the more in-your-life it is.

30
This dynamic is most evident in dreams, where fixing the point on attention on something will cause it to develop more detail, more solidity, more real-ness, but it works everywhere we care to be conscious, because it is all our dream of a sort anyway.

1
Appreciation is the giving of attention. To truly appreciate something, we have to consciously immerse ourselves in it. Eg. this is most visceral in our consumption of food: our capacity for appreciation is proportional to our degree of sensory/awareness participation.

https://twitter.com/saul_mondriaan/status/1595890654747377664

2
Our capacity for appreciation relies on our capacity, and willingness, to be aware of, to feel, to be immersed in the feeling-sensory experience. The more something fills our reality, the more we are in the act of appreciating it, by virtue alone of it existing in our field.

3
Enjoying something more is in itself an act of appreciation. When we like something, it makes sense for us to expand our awareness so to embrace more of it, and in general, appreciating things more means embracing things more with our joyful awareness.

https://twitter.com/saul_mondriaan/status/1595890652763471872

4
Awareness itself is a Giving because awareness is transformative. The very act of observation moves time forward, and time is a measure of change. In that sense, awareness itself brings change (in that which exists, and is thus predisposed-to-change)

https://twitter.com/celestialboon/status/1210961585784729601

5
This applies also to far more earthy matters. For example, we say that "it's the thought that counts" with gifts because the important part of a gift is less the cost of it and more the giving something that the person really likes/wants/needs, ...

6
... and that knowledge comes from knowing someone intimately, from observation, from the Giving of your awareness to them. To put it bluntly, it's like saying that a good gift is 20% cost and 80% knowing the person well enough. Awareness *is* part of the gift.

7
There is also an understanding that attention/awareness is a tangible force -and currency- in our lives when we talk of the attention economy, when we talk of engagement with content, when you feel a high on stage for having all the public's attention on you.

8
In matters of social relationships, appreciation is the "[...] small gestures of gratitude that support relationship loyalty and bonding" because those are the glue, and the spice, and also the meat-and-potatoes of a good relationship. They're what a good relationship is made OF.

9
AND, they are what supports a good relationship and helps it grow and become stronger, more intimate, more meaningful, more lively, more vital, more intense.

40
And again, this goes for everything - the more you participate in something, the more you immerse yourself in something, the more it grows and the better you understand how to contribute further to it. Through such acts, things grow and dance and move forward in the play of life.

1
This was one large alchemical *solve* that can be coagulated into a very simple understanding, since appreciation *is* something that is very fundamental and very elementary. Appreciation is like when you're playing a game with your friends.

2
Appreciation is the knowing that you're playing a game that you like with your friends. Appreciation is the good feelings that you get from playing this game with your friends.

3
Appreciation is you contributing to the game, is you playing the game, so that it keeps being good and interesting and enjoyable for you and for everyone else.

4
It fundamentally is just this. It's really not any more complicated than this. But, as they say, simplicity is the ultimate sophistication, and it can take a winded road indeed to reach the simplest of destinations sometimes.

5
It all distills down to a single, coherent understanding that applies to all levels, even if it is at the same time a mental attitude, a feeling, an energy, a behaviour. In spirit, these are all the same; they are all facets of the same gem.


I MUST stress that the proper, appreciative way to live your life, your body, is to live in awareness of your whole body. We do ourselves untold disservice when we are not present to the intelligence, the wisdom, the stories, the vicissitudes of our whole body.


The first act of love, of appreciation, towards ourselves should be to be aware of ourselves, to be present to ourselves and to stay present to ourselves. To be aware of how our legs feel, how our heart is doing, what do the hands strive for, what are those knots doing there...


The seed of all outward expansion starts from the center, and the seed of appreciation is the awareness of the body, for it is through the body that we can find our center.


Appreciation is a force of immeasurable power in our lives. Appreciation is what can dispel any dark cloud in our life. This is also spelled out quite literally in Stutz, which is an amazing watch btw

In Stutz there are no less than three separate exercises concerning appreciation.
