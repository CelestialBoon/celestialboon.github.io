the actualized.org rant against morality


maybe something about morality idk, what I said to chroma expanded with the rant about morality

CelestialBoon - 06/09/2018
well @Chroma , you asked me to comment on yesterday's debate and I've gotten a read at it
and I think the main sticking point would be your reliance on moral universalism to serve as fulcrum of the debate. This idea is either right or wrong, so if it's right accept it, or if it's wrong dethrone it
This stemming from the very concept that there would be, there should be some universal ways of dictating behaviour, some truths that we believe to be self-evident that serve as infallible morals(edited)
and I don't believe in any of that.
You asked if you were aligned with the Sovereign Integral, well here's a part of the Manifesto:
There is no truth that can be written, spoken, or thought unless it is conceived and expressed through the Language of Unity.(edited)
I don't believe in morals. I believe in Goodhart's Law. That When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. I believe in the innate capacity of men to find ways around things, to hack, to exploit, to perverse, to countermeasure.
Alan Watts calls it the irreducible rascality of man. The innate element of chaos that is the first half of creativity. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6bPH5H5NI
Laws by common definition are made to lay judgement, innately, and in this way they create separation; between the lawful and the unlawful, between the right and the wrong, between the correct and the incorrect. But the universe does not work this way; it has never been split in two at any point, much like the Yin and the Yang do not exist apart from one another, and indeed are concepts so ephemeral that they also do not exist outside of one another; each also contains the other.(edited)
By the very nature of things, none of these laws can be universal by the singular point of fact that they decree separation, and separation is so much of an illusory concept that it is innately surpassed, made invalid in some way or another.(edited)
The universal "law" that I believe in is the Law of Thelema. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will. Notice how there is no judgement in it.(edited)
Any other law can be exploited, perverted, corrupted, abused, or just found inappropriate because it deals in the concepts of duality, of the mind, and that's akin to trying to find a natural number that's bigger than all the other numbers.(edited)
In this sense, debating on these matters cannot reasonably have the point of arriving at a single shared universal accepted code of conduct, because such a thing cannot even exist. It ontologically cannot be the point of such discussions.(edited)
When you try to use such laws and morals and concepts to try and direct the current action to the present problems, well that's what you're doing. You're acting towards solving a singular present problem, and those morals are just concepts that support you in that argumentation, but they are not anything more than that. Action doesn't strictly need any argumentation for or against it, per se. It can be spontaneous; it can be driven by matters that sit outside of the mind.(edited)
When I reach out in such debate, it is not to dictate or convince, but more to increase understanding. There are truths that can inform behaviour, but never completely determine it, much less force it, and it is on these truths that I usually focus.
discussing the more singular point, war is in the way of things. It is plainly observable because it's already happened.
We see nature as possessing a singular harmony and yet at some level organisms kill one another, eat one another. With life comes death, and with creation comes destruction. This is the way of things around here, and they are there for a purpose.
I'm just gonna, quote Quantusum again

“Some people believe that the shadows are sinful, evil, composed to constrain and manipulate people, and yet I would tell you that, without the shadows, the heart is purposeless. And without purpose, then spiritual living is simply impossible within the world of appearances.
“There are people who want to build an ideal world of fairness and mutual respect. They want everyone to be just, kind, loving and generous. They want the order and balance of the perfected world to be in the world of appearances, and this will never happen, nor is it desirable.”
“Why not?” I asked. “If the alternative is war and hate and injustice, why isn’t it desirable?”
“Because the world of appearances is not real. It is the sandbox of souls. Souls can enter and build things that live for a minute and then dissolve in someone else’s footprint. The sandbox, as big as it seems, is contained in a single atom of an infinite world, and this world cannot fit inside the sandbox, and yet some believe the sandbox should be just like this infinite world.
“The world of appearances was created to encompass both light and shadows. It was to allow souls a chance to activate deeper levels of empathy and understanding and to fully appreciate the inter-connection of one life to another in an endless chain.”
“But if the world of appearances isn’t real,” I asked, “then why bother to change it, to improve it, to make it more just and fair for all? Isn’t that purposeless, too?”
“This is the paradox of living in the world of appearances,” Dou Xing whispered. “On the one hand you have a sandbox of souls that is temporal and always changing. This sandbox evolves. Its dynamism is entrained by its source—its ultimate creator— and it is slowly brought to its source over the measures of space and time.
“As the shadows lessen, then so does the light. The way of reading with the heart is to understand this duality as an ally and not a diminishment of your spirituality.

(edited)

“It all begins in the heart for that is how the soul sees, and as the soul sees, it is expressed through the mind-body. If the mind-body is inspired to express love, it is because the heart made it possible. Expressing love into the world of appearances is the purpose of spiritual living. What comes of this love is left to the mystery of First Source’s larger design. It is not delivered to the world in order to make the world perfect, without shadows, or to vanquish duality.”

I feel like this is a really clear response and it's focused quite powerfully on me and my life. I know because of how it made something inside me squirm around in protest as I read it. XD
I really appreciate this, Celestial.
Because it does not feel abstract, it feels pointed and specific, so now I suppose I have this row to hoe because I need a well-established almost infallible clear energetic heart to stand up and hold the walls and ceiling up whereas before perhaps it was this dualistic moralistic intuition, and because of specific harms I've endured, that's not decorative; it's structural.
Like this preexisting idea in me is what's keeping me from flying to action against the things that harmed and harm me.(edited)
Historically.
Though I've been working at compassion and forgiveness as you know, it's tough when dealing with things like old traumas that sometimes jut out into the 'now' like aggressive venomous snakes in the grass or something.(edited)
CelestialBoon - 06/09/2018
I can imagine. They're usually easier to deal with from the safety of distance in time. It's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it, as they say
Chroma - 06/09/2018
And I'm like, "kids play in this grass."
And I cannot fathom standing aside to watch them get bitten.
CelestialBoon - 06/09/2018
and even then I'm severely understating the effects, since we would be talking about your emotional liberation here. The internal resetting, from where the clear action can actually spring forth.
Like, it's a bit difficult to internalize because it's a fairly new paradigm overall but forgiveness is the platform of neutrality from which the pure action can be achieved, undisturbed. Just transparently received from the depths of the heart and acted upon.
This holding a grudge kind of thing does not actually help; it just clouds the clearest source of discernment that we possess.
Chroma - 06/09/2018
However I may feel about those snakes' right to exist as a part of some universal matrix of life, I don't really want to see them become a force in others' lives. I want to contain them, or mow the grass so they're visible, or let them live elsewhere (and not here). And it's sort of this challenge to think outside that box, more creatively, about the issues at stake.
CelestialBoon - 06/09/2018
Yeah of course, that's love at play, acting in the moment to guide reality towards a new outcome.
but it is not action born of any of the densities that constrict our thought that people usually use to focus their morals
it is not a task of the mind to judge, only to modulate what's already in the heart to fit the worlds of form.
Chroma - 06/09/2018
nods so again, I feel like this is a really powerful and direct message for me to keep in mind, and find ways to pull these mental judgements back like removing some shroud from my heart.
but
this has been like some crutch, like some way of making sense of a world that's at times been quite harmful and traumatic directly to me.
I'm sure it emerged somehow from my upbringing, having been sent to a Mennonite school grades 2-8 and suffering the first of those harms and traumas around grade 4 or 5
CelestialBoon - 06/09/2018
and indeed, it is something that must be replaced gradually, observed and reinterpreted part by part, piece by piece.
Chroma - 06/09/2018
To the extent this stuff I'm reacting to is in my past, I don't find it challenging
but when it moves again in my 'now'
CelestialBoon - 06/09/2018
I know there's much on your plate already but the Techniques of the Intuitive Intelligence of Lyricus 6 would help you a great deal in tackling all that
Chroma - 06/09/2018
I pick up some dualistic sword and shield almost reflexively
because of course I'm not going to let it traumatize me ever again
In that moment
CelestialBoon - 06/09/2018
yeah I'm, definitely pointing you in that direction, they're something that have eased me a great deal wrt facing my past and I believe they might help you as well
Chroma - 06/09/2018
I'm ready to slay myself some dragons. http://www.ancient-origins.net/sites/default/files/field/image/St.-George-and-the-Dragon.jpg
(also, who is that woman? XD )
CelestialBoon - 06/09/2018
funny you should bring st George into this, since I've read somewhere (failing to recover the source) that the original tale would contain a befriending of the dragon instead of the slaying, and has since been altered
Chroma - 06/09/2018
Somehow that doesn't surprise me. Well, we all know how that goes.
CelestialBoon - 06/09/2018
besides that dragon is clearly that maiden's pet, so George is kinda being inappropriate here :stuck_out_tongue:
Chroma - 06/09/2018
grins
Actually specifically for dragons
I learned to love them, like
there was this big countercultural effort to restore dragons as something to be loved not feared
CelestialBoon - 06/09/2018
oh yeah
Chroma - 06/09/2018
that deeply influenced me
