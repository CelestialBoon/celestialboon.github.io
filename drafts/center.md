A tentative meta-story about the Search for Betterment

history as this ongoing search of a transcendence
this search for betterment
for something good and true and beautiful
and it's all over, mckenna spoke about it, what is it that we're looking for exactly, well you can always put it in your own words

and this is all over, from the search of Utopia to the more common and personal figuring one's own life out. We're in search of purpose, in search of a paradigm to life that would in some way transmute it into something out of our dreams

and this is a search that is shared by pretty much everyone, at some level. Some may have hung the hat somewhere but it's at the very least sitting somewhere buried deep down, others are taking a more active interest in it, being it spreading awareness to the world's problems by retweeting them, to travelling to India in search of enlightenment.

For this article I'd like to focus on the personal level, since it's the one that the individual might most productively focus on, and besides the level where I've collected the most experience dealing with.

Between changing the self and changing others, the easiest path is usually changing oneself.

So what are people looking for exactly when they say they want to improve their *own* ife? Ultimately, things like property, money and such are easily discerned as just means to an end; while the pursuit to happiness is a tricky concept, it indeed contains a core of truth in that what people are looking for is experiencing some state of consciousness or other, to some degree of life saturation.

Some people look for the flow state, others just want to feel better about themselves, their lives and their choices; it can be a search for liberation from past trauma, or overcoming depression; it can be looking for the state of enlightenment, inspiration, or being in connection with one's soul, jhanas, satori, what have you.

Now, how is this accomplished?

Well, each path is their own, really, but there are very consistent common points that I'd wish to highlight in this piece, so to make each individual process more transparent in its ultimate aims, and how they should be approached.

## The motivation to Journey

No journey is ever taken without some need or another, and this goes double for journeys of self-seeking and self-transformation.

It can be a deep-felt need, a life and death situation, an unease, a hobby, a desire to expand one's consciousness towards the new and unknown, or to pick up a skill, or to get richer. In general, it's the search for a change, from the basic shakeup to a transcendence of present conditions.

fake it till you make it, to change your life change your mind, a new journey consists in having new eyes, they're all talking about the same thing at the core, and that thing is, that change begins with oneself, at some level or another; be it thoughts, emotions, actions, beliefs, and what else. Once one realizes this, and is willing to challenge themselves at some level, then the search begins.

Of course, this search may be unsuccessful, but ultimately, the only way you can truly lose is to give up. You may stumble on the path; encounter plenty of unforseen circumstances, events and consequences; your plans might be derailed, or, seen from a more generous light, updated. You *will* find something as the time goes on and the effort pours in; it might be what you were looking for, it might be something else. It might even be much better than what you could have imagined in the first place. While you may not know what awaits you out there, it's true that those who venture out to look *do* find something waiting for them. From there, it's a matter of paying attention, and adjusting the course if it's needed.

There are a number of pieces of general advice to facilitate the search, but they are better left for another post entirely.

## 1. Finding the Center

It may have taken a little, it may have taken a lot, and especially a lot of suffering and skin-shedding, but at some people stumble into *something else*. Something that they can easily tell it's *different* if they're paying enough attention. It is, invariably, one or more states of consciousness. This is what they find, and this is in fact what they've been looking for.

It is a state of consciousness. This is worth repeating, since it can be surprising at some level that our search would lead us to something so immaterial, ethereal, and ephemerous. And yet, at the heart of any and all of these searches, distilling them at their essence, doesn't there sit a desire to **feel good**, in some shape or form?  
And feeling good amounts to a state of your consciousness, regardless of any reasoning behind it or causal chain of effects that brought you there. It is a surprisingly simple and unifying concept sitting at the heart of all this personal search.

So what is this state *about*? Well, there's no singular state I can refer to as single destination, and I am going to focus only on a particular subset of them, those that stem from a desire to *better* oneself in some way or another, because they tend to bear many similarities.

The stuff that counts is attainable eventually, and that's because it's something innate to each and every person.
Most of the time, what they find is something inner, something that gives them contentedness or ecstasy or bliss or a sense of connection or satisfaction or a sense of purpose or productivity or excitement or whatever. 
Those states are what I'll refer to as the Center of that particular journey.

For someone, this Center is the stillness inside them, their place of communion with Soul, their core essence, their place of utter Love and gnosis, of non-duality and Oneness. I'm citing this specifically since I personally believe that it's something especially worth pursuing in one's life, the core of their divine nature.
Also, it has to be stated that this does not amount to a single state, but a collection of shades and variations, which are mentioned in doctrines of consciousness, such as Buddhism, with varying degrees of success (since communicating such states/realities in words is a troublesome affair indeed).

In particular, such states are very often something that's less sitting on a high peak for you to reach, and more something that's laying behind a number of boxes that you have to move out of the way first. It's less about making the effort to reach something that was previously outside of it, and more a process of skin-shedding, of abandoning something old and obsolete, and dealing with some crap, or just being led through the steps, in order to realize it was always there near you.

Notice that this Center doesn't need to be internal to oneself, especially intially. It can be the support and the inner radiance of a friend, the welcoming environment of a therapy session allowing you to unfold, it could be a psychedelic drug opening up doors wihin you that you never imagined existing, much less accessible. Plenty of help on the road can be offered from other people and things and beings.

Once you have encountered it, once it's there, it's very important to *pay attention* and remember it, since you have effectively found what you were looking for, as ephemeral as it may be. It doesn't need to be a remembering made of thoughts, but there has to be at least a concept, an idea, a sketch of a process to get there, whatever allows you to get a leg up on finding it again next time. 

Because if you've gotten there once, chances are you can get there again, and possibly over and over again.

But, like everything else, this is a choice left to the individual. Perhaps, they will be completely satisfied with just reaching this peak once or twice, and carrying the lessons imparted, or the healing received, with them from that point onwards, and that's completely fine. For them, the journey stops here, and what follows might be a return to ordinary life, or a search for something else instead. 

What some other people in different circumstances do, is realize that they have found something worth keeping around, and so they move on to the next step of the journey. 

## 2. Nurturing the Center

Many people have found enlightenment to be a fleeting affair, and not something that sticks with them entirely by itself. Maybe the peace of meditation doesn't accompany them when they most need it. Maybe they have reached the heights of bliss and ecstasy and are still plagued by doubts and anxiety in their daily life. Maybe they have felt what it means to be in the zone, but are not just satisfied with a single good art piece to their name, and hunger for more. Maybe they just want to keep feeling good.

So what then? Well, what else but to keep going at it, right?

This stage is when things get more real, and start taking a definite foothold in your life. The plans are for this state to become part of your routine.

nurturing is the practice such as meditation and whatnot, learning to know the space, to stay in the space, and to do the things that you set yourself to do in such a state, even if that amounts to stillness, silence, and awareness.

and this also involves getting there using less and less help that you'd consider unreliable or occasional. If you don't have access to it literally all the time, and can do so, then consider weaning yourself off it, finding new techniques to bring it forward into your consciousness, either by finding them or just stumbling into them. Possibilities are offered

with time it gets easier ie. easier to go in, more "productive", and/or more ways discovered to drop in and stay in

This is something that requires further investment. As much as it's usually much easier to plunge in the second time, and the ones after it, it still takes dedication and commitment. It is a choice that has to be reaffirmed every time, and sometimes it's a given, and sometimes it encounters more resistance than that.

The best basic way I know to bring oneself to action is to have the purpose of it clear, and this is most easily achieved through routine repetition. It can just take a minute of each day, taking the stance to reaffirm just what do we have in mind to achieve. As usual with this kind of things, emotional involvement and visualization are great ways to deeply reinforce the message and give it more potency, more inertia.

One reason this works is by providing the ego mind something to latch on, [to go "yeah okay" about](https://customer.io/blog/because-persuasion/), and just go with it, giving it a reason to get out of the way of putting ideas into action.

Not only that, but a natural outcome is that this routine becomes more fully integrated into one's life; it finds the most suitable time to be practiced, and you may develop rituals leading both into it and out of it (the most obvious example would be some stretching before/after exercise), in order to improve the quality of the practice itself, providing easy triggers for you to reach the desired states, and transporting the benefits into the rest of the life.

Enough of this practicing, and you can start discover some collateral benefits to it with time:

- The adjunct states

For anything worth pursuing, the rabbit hole goes much deeper than one could imagine at first.  
Through familiarity and increased ease and confidence, within the practice the horizon naturally expands and lets you glimpse more parts of the landscape of being. As with the rest, this can happen through focused inquiry or by just stumbling though it; nonetheless, it remains that a vast scape of ways of being and doing is available to the seeker, and should you be willing, you can explore it, and figure more things out for yourself, and get to know more about this Center of yours, its variations, its subtleties, its idiosyncrasies. This can lead to further revelations, and even upgrades of your ways of being or doing.

- The increased ability to process what's outside this state from the inside

This may sound obvious to some seekers, such as people undergoing therapy, since dealing with what's outside the therapist's office is the whole purpose of the thing; but more in general, any Center worth its salt provides a privileged space of alternate perception and more fluent capabilities, and this can be put to use either to find solutions and information to apply subsequently to life, or just to solve things right then and there.  

This can be felt most clearly with the creative process, since it enables many people to look at their issues from a different angle once it's been put on the page, or even to reach catharsis and closure about them.

Emotive matters are another illustrative example, since they heavily influence the thinking process, and having a supportive emotional space (even if it's something that's provided from the outside, such as a good therapist, or a good tripsitter) enables the influence of this space to spread, and bring renewal and healing and transformation.

- The bleedover

Again, this is obvious enough for some, like meditators. Stay enough in your Center, and the rest of your life starts shifting around you, taking on different tones, opening up to be reasoned with in different ways, enabling new connections. 

For some others, it comes as something of a surprise that the practice is effectively changing them. While that would usually be for the best, especially in the long run, it's possible that such changes would open up with destabilization periods, much like the period between two points of equilibrium is could easily be characterized by disequilibrium. This can force you into some difficult decisions, but very much in general, the first step to always do is to recognize and accept such changes, since at the core, being aware of *what is* is the first step to doing something about it, one way or another.

These can be rather crucial moments, for your sense of self-identity usually rests on such decisions. Being faced with the direct consequences of the journey, for better or worse, puts you in the position to decide whether these are acceptable outcomes or not; whether it's worth to dial it back, or to continue as usual, or to dive even further.

This usually hinges on your willingness to change, and to abandon the comfort of routine in order to embrace the unknown.  
Some changes reach deeper than others, and they provide a very fertile space to contemplate just *what it means to be yourself*. Will you still be *you* when all this is said and done? Does the question make any sense at all? What are you hanging on to that defines *you*, and are you willing to part with it and explore new ways to be you?

Some people will tone it down at this point, and that's fine; perhaps it wasn't for them.  
some people will keep at it and will have found a nice injection of variety, productivity, satisfaction, or just all-around contentedness, into their lives.

---

So ideally, here we reached a nice enough junction; the practice has become something of a regular fixture of life; it brings improvements to it, and one could be completely satisfied with that.

Then again, there are *some* people that won't. That for some reason feel the need to push further. This starts to be about leaving a life behind and embracing a new one, and there's usually good reasons that motivate people to do it, sometimes bottom-of-the-barrel kind of reasons.

Still, this sort of idea might be novel to them; that they could leave behind their whole inner way of *being* and embrace a new one. Is it really possible? Is it even advisable? Is it truly worth it? And so on, and so forth.

Once this idea has wormed its way through, it starts to illuminate a very different sort of landscape, containing some very novel questions and decisions.

## Taking the leap

Sometimes just a part-time shift isn't enough for people: one clear example is chronic depression. Sometimes it's something that won't go away without a radical change in your default state of consciousness; and *that's* where one starts contemplating if they could indeed live from this Center all the time. Drastic times call for drastic measures.  
It would sound like a crazy idea for many, but many others don't have enough to lose to *not* contemplate such a proposition.

the idea is simple: if it's good enough to be sought to be sometimes in, if it's good enough to provide insight into one's life, then it's possibly good enough to be *the rest of the time* in; or at least, something close enough might fit the bill, after some battle-hardening, and be able to stand to face the rest of one's life.

This is what people are talking about when they say to "make your life a meditation," for example. Which also shows that this is something that is definitely in the realm of possibility *and* viability, if the Center is good enough.

Needless to say, it is quite the radical undertaking, requiring substantial amounts of commitment. Some may barely imagine what it means to take such an undertaking, and that's more or less the point. To live under a new state of consciousness is to explore a new way of being entirely, which is somewhat difficult to bring into the imagination before it is actually experienced.

What does it mean for the person to change in such a manner?

Well, as basic reassurance, a person changes in such a manner much more than we'd expect. The ego-personality as monolithic, unchanging display of self is little more than a convenient illusion; existence itself is change, and beyond that, we change masks all the time as the occasion presents itself. We are different selves when we go to work, or when we're with friends, or playing a sport, or alone in the company of ourselves, or with our pets, or when we're sick, and so on. Each of us has some masks they wear on habitual occasions, but there's always the possibility to opening to some new experience, or coming to an old one with a new approach.

Usually we converge into a single mode of behaviour in certain situations because we are prone to optimize, and in most cases a single way of approach is good enough.
Moreover, it is built-in into societal conceptions that one should *be themselves* in the sense of behaving in a singular, reliable manner for most situations, that would not change much from time to time, which leaves people to search for expression of their innate multifaceted-ness by assuming different identities, online or otherwise, or more in general, through the experience of stories, passively (like with media) or actively (like acting or roleplaying).

This is a situation that has been built around the already existing tendency of the ego-personality to perceive itself as stable and unchanging, which compounds the rigidity of the whole ordeal. To change in such a manner means not only to change internally, and face resistance there about it, but also changing externally, and having to face the perceived mismatch between what you were before and what you are now doing, which "isn't truly you," or "is not like yourself." Which is a very curious notion when you think about it for a while, that being oneself might be limited to satisfying some people's narrow range of expectations about your own behaviour.

That said, such a shift would also introduce further unknowns into one's life, by necessity of venturing outside one's comfort zone, which no matter how dreadful it actually is, is very often still preferred to uncertainty. 

This is most definitely not a decision for everyone, or that every Center is ready to bear the weight of; most simply, because most people don't need it, or feel they don't need it.

I'll repeat it, the Center HAS to be good enough to bear the weight of what you'll put it through. The good news is, by trying you'll know either way, and then you can move on in both cases.

As much as it is very likely a reversible decision, it is still not a choice made lightly, because often there's a lot of courage to summon to even approach the very idea of it.  
As much as the process itself is mostly reversible, there's still a lot that gets put on the line, which amounts to your very sense of self. It is not just a question of time and commitment; you are looking to, in a sense, redefine your very self. Embracing the idea itself can be troublesome, like embracing the possibility that you could do extreme sports in the future, such as skydiving. Even the mere idea of it often finds resistance before even the possibility of being seriously contemplated, and it is the same here.

So naturally, in order to overcome all those hurdles, the question springs naturally: how committed are you to this? With enough reason to push forward and little enough to lose, it gets a lot easier to contemplate the jump.  

## 3. Becoming the Center

So once we're here, you've decided to take the leap. You are comfortable with your Center, and can assume it in some situations. You have already used it to some effect, and it's tine for some stress-testing.

What this is about is not just staying in this center, but *operating* from it, as long and as often as possible. The point is to do it eventually all the time. Life as meditation.


SO basically at this point you have some idea of this thing and how it works and how you can induce it, but it's a little fragile and it doesn't stand to the scossoni of daily life. And you might for example find yourself distracted from it, and forgetting that you should come from this space to take life, it gets challenged, it gets criticized, you start back up the old routines, yadda yadda, take a breather and try again.

so you explore this space and you get used to it and you learn more about it and you explore related states and circumstances and it starts filling your quiet moments
and spread takes the willingness to change, to take that and override the rest, to change habit and disperse denstities and to wake up another person, you'll do this and you'll see yourself changing and you'll have to know that this is actually the way to do it, you'll be changed by the time this is done and you have to accept it as it's going on

It is a journey of rediscovery, many things become new again, and have to be reassimilated from this new perspective

by now, you've grown accustomed to it, and it's more a question of bringing it forward in more demanding situations, trailing the long tail


once you have it, it's up to you to decide it, is it something worth keeping? Worth having the rest of your life around? this is a massive decision, because yes, it's always there, but it requires you to nurture this connection and develop your ways around it. It's a commitment, it requires you to come back to this space again and again, it's an open meditation, it's a lifelong meditation. When people share the secret of enlightenment, it's this, it's knowing this state and being in it as often as possible. That's it.


The deal is, to take this Center and expand its influence gradually
the important part is not to lose sight of it. It's about staying there and operating outwards. It's that little island of sanity and stability from which the rest should come


### The obstacles

skin-shedding

This occurs in a number of ways, but most commonly, it's achieved either by reaching a metaphorical bottom, and being delivered some sort of insight there, or by active pursuit that leads one there, or at least once they've abandoned enough of their previous weights, like preconceptions, pretenses of the ego, and so on and so forth

people want to change, some of them want to change themselves, and the biggest part of the others are better served focusing on the easiest thing for them to change, that is again, themselves.

doubt

willingness to change

it's a surprisingly common trap, we're used to not pushing our luck and thinking some things are too good to be true, well, you're looking for something that will be your core, so it will have to stand up to the test one way or another. If it doesn't, you look for something else. No need to keep any illusion up, you're going for broke, and no need to shy away from breaking it either

the humdrum of daily life drawing you back into old habits, that you have optimized against

commitment

iteration

the resistance to change


and the commitment
and the willingess to change
and the habit
and all the world outside that you have built around that is going to resist this change because what you had was what you perfected over the years to cope with it, so anything new is going to be raw in comparison and will need to be iterated upon, and that's why you have to stay committed
(like that Cleaning your room piece from JBPM)
it goes down until one isn't willing to take this shit anymore, and one gathers the strength to change, and to accept what comes instead of that
if you don't have that commitment, which can be desperation, can be curiosity, can be fortitude, doesn't matter, if you don't have the willingness and the driving power to bring change and accept that change, then you'll likely just stay there until you do, until you do accept that you will bring changes on yourself and damn the consequences.

you are the creator of your own reality
there's an absurd paradox that's quite difficult to summarize in that once you start searching for the alternative, you could stumble any time into your own inner stillness and realize that inner peace and contentedness was there all along
and what is needed is not to reach for something that will make you happy, but to practice staying in this center as long as possible

### The tricks

Remember that life is perfectly imperfect. The ups and downs are just part of the experience. It's going to be a matter of perseverance and presence and self-awareness and quite a lot of patience and resilience. It would be worth alone if it trained you to develop those qualities, but you're doing something likely very useful with them as well.

optimal amount of uncertainty
learn to enjoy the process, and the unknown, and the uncertainty, and if it's frustrating sometimes because things get in your way, adn you don't know how it goes

and refresh your motivation, find some grounding, FIND STEPPING STONES and use them to make your progress stick
this is super imporant, as partial as your progress can be, hold on to it, build on it to reach greater heights still. As much as you can drop one for the next, keep at least one to build upon

finding ways to bring it forward in situations

recentering

building a routine around it, because it helps a lot both ways (for the rest of the life, and for the skills themselves)

developing stepping stones
and holding fast to checkpoints

as always, remember the reason

it's about doing things from this state as often as you can, and coming back to it when you lose it in distraction. You already have the techniques to reach it, you just iterate on getting there more quickly, more easily, and in more demanding circumstances, and from there, learn how to edit the inside and the outside more and more effectively and efficiently

and of course, the practice will keep providing insights, discoveries and so on, you may found out that the Center goes much deeper than you realized, and has a lot of deeper subtleties to it

this should also be the ideal state to process your shit from, both external and internal. Again, you should be willing to change your life, and this Center is the best place from which you can operate to do so

from the center, moving outwards, processing is integration

### The lessons

realizing your own power, your energetic responsibility to yourself first of all
taking life into own hands
imposing your narrative into the world

and exxploring more of the self
and discovering the things hidden
and integrating, and transforming
and doing it from this space, but also opening to integration, derivation, it's taking this space and expanding it, integrating this into something new

like akido

state-bound stuff 

vulnerability is what opens to the new, and then you can integrate
it's this balance of vulnerability and the quiet strength




======================================================

A large part of the commitment is about not settling for less, which is tantalizingly easy at many steps of the way. Ultimately, the choice rests on you on each moment; if you have the possibility to back down, then the question of whether to turn back may come to attention a surprising number of times. A strong reason to move forward is then almost indispensable.

Potentially you could make it so you'd live from that Center, from that state of consciousness, or something similar or higher still, for the rest of your life. If it's a good enough Center, it's definitely something attainable, at least in principle.

Sometimes this change is difficult, no actually, most times it's difficult, because all kinds of cultural bs and being yourself and whatnot. but we change all the time, and we should be able to accept that we can transcend the simple single personality and just playing a stereotype, a mask, because we are so much more,s o much larger than that

wearing a thousand masks and can wear many more, and 

and it's about a radical change, and actually taking that change to the radical logical outcome

This is the part where you don't come down to compromises and you chase this Center again and again
and really, most of it is not settling for something

most importantly, this can be resisted because of the innate squeamishness that we have about shifting states of consciousness, we're talking here about basically living from a different state, regardless of how far out it is, and that's not something that's easily accepted for many
it's a radical change as radical gets, and it takes the courage to go through it and transform your life in the most profound of ways
there are countless sayings that amount that the easiest, most profound kind of change is the inner one, but that is what the biggest way to change yourself internally amounts to: changing your default state of consciousness, and that's what under the lines, the spiritual paths try to lead people towards. and what I'm hoping to summarize here.


it's a condition that doesn't satisfy, and so people come to search for more, they put things on the line, most importantly they put *themselves* on the line, meaning they not only put their time and commitment into it, but they also accept the possibility that they will change from the ordeal

So this is where it gets puts to the test, at least if you're willing to do it. What follows is, do you want to go further or not? Because if it stands up to scrutiny, you can bring that into the rest of your life.

if it's good to take on the worst of your llife head-on, it's good enough to take the *rest* of your life head-on with

FINDING THE CENTER 

some may just stop here, don't need that much
like some exceptional highs or revelations
maybe those people didn't have that many troubles to begin with and are satisfied with this

So now you've encountered a Center, and you have had enough presence of mind to commit it to memory, and you're willing to go for more. What happens then?

Well, then there's the rest of the owl to draw. Meaning that while the first hurdle is overcome, now you're in for the long haul. 

It becomes your new default state, to replace the previous, and from here, your life has changed in the truest sense.
and the piece with staying at the center, and expanding from there

becoming is bringing it out to the world, and impose on it your narrative, to keep in the space and bring it out, by personal choice, come into your power and defend this space and let it pour forth, colonize reality
