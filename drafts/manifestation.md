but it's like, she can build on this, even through sleep
the only failure is admitting failure
you can always use what happens as stepping stones
you can learn from the events, you can ask to be brought further
you can iterate and you can iterate some more

In many, almost all of the things we do, we find ourselves thinking in general objectives, in very abstract goals, that we end up acting upon in all the precise and minute ways of the physical, for one. The workings, the minutiae, are mostly hidden to us, and they are simply abstracted away, to the point that focusing on them can be actually harmful to the success of the act.

In much of the same way, our intents determine our directions, our thoughts, our actions, in ways that are not conscious; to us, it simply happens, once you have taken resolve.

`If you ask the god
of Spring how a flower blooms,
even they do not know.`

The world is much more of a *process* than a series of discrete events, in this sense; it is something that is self-sustaining, and that can be influenced, gently shifted in course, corrected so that it moves on its own towards a destination or other, and
