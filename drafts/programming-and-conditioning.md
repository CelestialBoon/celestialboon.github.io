At some level
I'm afraid I'll come out the other side kinda...specialer
CelestialBoon - Yesterday at 10:08 PM
no kidding
but again, so far no one's complained, yakno
Cadey~ - Yesterday at 10:08 PM
Yeah
CelestialBoon - Yesterday at 10:09 PM
fucking caring what others think of you, miss me with that gay shit hah
Cadey~ - Yesterday at 10:09 PM
The programming makes you want to fall into line with the herd
It's very subtle
CelestialBoon - Yesterday at 10:10 PM
I've been explicitly fighting it for years
I think it shows in the advice I give

Cadey~ - Yesterday at 10:14 PM
I wonder
Was that the OOBE itself?
CelestialBoon - Yesterday at 10:14 PM
you know, dreams are pretty much OOBE already
Cadey~ - Yesterday at 10:14 PM
OOBE-ing to a dream scenario in place of being in the body
CelestialBoon - Yesterday at 10:14 PM
it's not like I haven't been telling you lmao
Cadey~ - Yesterday at 10:14 PM
Yeah
It's all like
Clicking now
Idk
CelestialBoon - Yesterday at 10:14 PM
mhm
yeah it takes more than just the words
Cadey~ - Yesterday at 10:15 PM
There's like
The words
But the words are just the product of the understanding
The words exist
And they can stand alone
But the understanding really roots the words into the meaning
CelestialBoon - Yesterday at 10:16 PM
the words are the net, but you gotta sweep to catch the meaning
Cadey~ - Yesterday at 10:17 PM
That fear is also something the girls have been low-key feeling for a long time, apparently
CelestialBoon - Yesterday at 10:17 PM
no wonder
Cadey~ - Yesterday at 10:18 PM
The fear that I'd be somehow become "lost" to things
CelestialBoon - Yesterday at 10:18 PM
the bleedover model is very very useful
Cadey~ - Yesterday at 10:18 PM
I think i know where the root of that thought came from
CelestialBoon - Yesterday at 10:18 PM
to really get into your head that some thoughts might not be yours at all
mm?
Cadey~ - Yesterday at 10:19 PM
A very well-meaning normie's reaction to Cadey attempting to explain the feeling of metta
What
Who even said that internally
Either way
CelestialBoon - Yesterday at 10:20 PM
forgiveness babe
which also amounts to yeah whatever in some cases hah
Cadey~ - Yesterday at 10:21 PM
Wait
Did i think that?
I was like
I wasn't paying attention to my own thoughts
CelestialBoon - Yesterday at 10:22 PM
I was wondering that myself, since you know, that's quite the exceedingly recent explanation
to a far older problem
mmm getting familiar with the intricacies of the programming?
it's a whole maze full of adventure
Cadey~ - Yesterday at 10:23 PM
No i mean like i kinda zoned out but like i was out of focus with what i normally identify as my thoughtstream
Like i was speaking aloud and simultaneously had earplugs in
But with thought
CelestialBoon - Yesterday at 10:24 PM
a runaway ego
Cadey~ - Yesterday at 10:24 PM
I can't seem to replicate that
Yet
Oh man
I must have done something
There goes the doubt
CelestialBoon - Yesterday at 10:25 PM
goes where?
Cadey~ - Yesterday at 10:25 PM
I sense it
I feel the doubt
But I'm not identifying with it
CelestialBoon - Yesterday at 10:26 PM
center. Bring yourself to your heart, and let what's there come out
Cadey~ - Yesterday at 10:28 PM
Vision is changing, a lot less red
Feeling something unblocking
CelestialBoon - Yesterday at 10:28 PM
:pray:
Cadey~ - Yesterday at 10:29 PM
My sacral, third eye and gut chakras all activated through that last bit
The doubt was incompatible
