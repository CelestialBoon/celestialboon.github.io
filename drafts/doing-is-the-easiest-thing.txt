doing is the easiest thing there is, small effort
the problematic thing is putting on the decision to do, which is fraught with mind and that "wait, haven't they conned you before into doing things?"
and that's why it's so easy for new systemmates to just do stuff
and why deprogramming is so important
and why that "just do it" thing, for most people that's all it takes, just the decision to do
of course there might be mental, body and emotional reactions, such as trauma flaring up (and the whole ordeal is just a "don't do that or you'll feel some things" deal) and you can just deal with those
or there's that indecision
or in general a bunch of mental blocks put up
