aesthetic as life directive
create, live, iterate your aesthetic, each moment

and what do you want your aesthetic to be about? as you do ask that, it is created around you, the difference with most people is that they don't recognize the power in such a choice, and they settle for others' ideas instead of refining their own, creating their own beauty and composition and pieces

and it can be about the physical and the nonphysical and it can be about absoutely everything and anything, it came out at teatro because of how spotlighty it gets in there about it

every moment, you can live that aesthetic, ask it of the Universe, dream of it, refine it, perfect it, integrate more and more of the Universe inside it

and the best part is when everything becomes part of it, when everything reveal its Source

and, the times listening to McKenna on the radio, knowing it was the Universe talking to you, and accepting it as such, and making yet more strides into accepting the Universe talking to you

and the video of mckenna
it works at several levels, but in general it's about having a more reliable compass than truth or goodness, more obvious, clearer, less ambiguous
and what most people do is cultivating an aesthetic that is about some fantasy place, but that's fine
some others, like the law of attraction guys, focus on the small steps from where they are now
and it takes some courage to both dream and be awake, the furries are the dreamers, and the LoA are the awake ones, but it takes both

also meta resolutions are more than welcome, it doesn't have to be an immediate resolution, you could go meta on it, like a theatre, and that's what also happens on psychedelics, there's an infinity of layers there
