shamanic ascent
getting the pearl of immortality from the deep well of darkness and resurfacing
but in the underworld the powerful stuff is ugly and smelly, and is powerful in that it can do both ways, it requires the firm will of the user
and here we've already in the ddarkness, we're in the underworld, and we're the pearl, we're the thing of power, with our experiences and our lessons and our power
and the ascent is coming to a place of high consciousness, but we came from high consciousness as well, so it's not just a matter of returning, but returning with something
and to return with something, this something has to be brought from the darkness gradually into the light. It has to be carefully protected and transformed on the way up, it has to be translated properly and accurately
the process of taking the darkness and seeing the fetish, and bringing that fetish up, back to the heavens (like Malidoma's journeys to the Underworld)
Malidoma's fetish as something that enriches the world above by the power of the world below
living in the underworld, surrounded by treasures and gifts, but gifts that have to be transmuted, they have to be distilled and purified in order to reach the heavens
and our journey here is to descend into the depths, to find the power, the truth, the light, and to carefully bring it back up
going up not forgetting the lessons, not losing sight of the objective, keeping focused and sharp like in a shamanic journey. Always remembering the purpose of the descent and the ascent
the "not forgetting where you came from", the ascent with purpose of keeping your lessons
the PURPOSE
in the same way, to materialize the spiritual is to conceive of the solution and carefully bridge it into manifestation, translate the energies into manifested ones, imagine it and then carefully bring it here

the descent is properly reaching the answer, the solution, the power, the reason
the ascent is coming back into life with the answer, protecting it during the ascent in consciousness. It's holding on to what we learned and to what serves us, to what is useful to us in a higher consciousnesss

it's about transporting things properly from one place to another, it's transportation, translation, memory, accordamento, ri-cordare, to keep something protected

to carve this treasure into the landscape, into ourselves, into things and people, to spread it
to carve it in things and actions and memory and words and people and the acts, keeping and spreading

the tree (labirinth of life), and the ascent as walking back the reunion with God, by going smaller, quieter, more attentive. The asccent is a whole program here
and the first step is desire, dall'angoscia che proviamo, il de-siderio di sorpassare anche quello che le stelle ci forniscono, di fare qualcosa di più, così che cominciamo a manifestare direttamente noi

dancing with the program (which means evolving because of the program)
