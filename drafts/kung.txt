kung
regularly practiced mastery
the way a river carves its bed
energetic mastery, the dynamic balance upheld with grace
the art of keeping things masterfully going
the practice and the mastery
kung like masterful music, the music itself, the moment of production itself, in that the mastery *is* the action, there's no mastery outside of the action, the mastery does not exist apart from the action, in the same way that there's no mastery of energy without actually directing its flow, accompanying it, dancing with it
there's no master without the act of the mastery

the eternal moment
the eternal practice, the eternal presence and participation
keeping at somehing for long, long, long enough to seem forever
the continuous practice, and participation, and iteration, and adventure

the seed that is gently led away from the plant so that it has space to develop
develop skills that instant solutions wouldn't allow: persistence, continuous presence, kung

bioarchitetto, writing those lasting changes in flesh
and the house is imperfect because it's the body which has to be perfect, it's the personal universe, it starts from teh center, it's the center first
the center, the void, the stillness, and it has to radiate outward from there

everyone has their own journey, everyone is in this game to learn something different, and yet all are part of the same purpose
I'm here to really learn that keeping-at-it, quel movimento delle radici che continua imperterrito, lento, attento, graduale e inesorabile e possente e continuo, anche se lento
gradual changes through continuous participation

life keeps having similar demands, and it makes sense to have a consolidated approach to it (like in math)

keeping at it, baseline of discipline, of application, of kung

shamanism makes sense because it is a kung. Chi kung, obv. Kung fu probably (like that kettle water simile)

it was difficult before to do because it has to start with the center. Change begins at the center, and it has to expand outward from there, no rushing or skipping steps, teh center comes first
