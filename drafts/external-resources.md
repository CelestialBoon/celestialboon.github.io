# Occult resources collection

In an effort to expedite the search of seekers, I have collected most occult libraries and assorted resources here. 

If it seems like a daunting task to peruse them, that's because it is. If it seems impossible to you that you'll absorb all this knowledge within your lifetime, that's because it is.
Each one of the authors below has, ideally, compiled their own vision, to the best of their abilities, of the greater picture, based on their experiences, and supported by their own seeking of truth. I invite you to act in the same manner; after all, experience is the greatest teacher. Seek truth above all, and trust yourself to be guided along your own unique path. This guidance does not come only from outside; much of the greater wisdom that shall direct you can come from within yourself, from your inspiration, from your own inner sense of discernment, from your intuition of greater realities, from the whispers of a greater self.

There is no greater truth that you shall find outside yourself, that the one that the deepest self of you, the true Being, can provide in the moment to moment.  
There is no need to move closer to truth when you yourself are truth. There is only to rediscover it within yourself. And when it is realized, to live it.
