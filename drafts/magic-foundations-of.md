Magic is mostly about manipulation of energy, which in turn could possibly alter the other 3 of the MEST

Basically it's energy influencing the rest in certain ways.

Principles of power (basically, when you attempt some ritual or other, what is going to determine its degree of success?)
0. Power. 
	It's gonna come from somewhere. You, entities, the Universe, some specific source (such as planets and stars and places etc.), of a certain frequency, with certain properties, etc. Energy is change, so you want some change, bring the energy. You can like, reshape some of it, so that's very efficient. Again, harmonization. Unification under common purpose. You can bring the energy, or open a channel, or let someone else provide, set up a collection, a self-replicating structure or just a funnel
1. Structure. 
	The repetition, the consolidation, the habit. The reason why people use old runes yadda yadda. The aggregation. The power of doubling as in the Power of One, The continuous unbroken manifestation
2. Geometry. 
	The fact that some ways of doing things are inherently more apt than others for accomplishing certain things (like you wouldn't go to swim in armor). The sacred geometry, right combos, the appropriate contexts, the correct workings, the right models, etc. THe sheer Efficiency, as seen from the inside.
3. Harmony. 
	How well it slots in with the rest, how well it is taken by an entity, how much it matches with the greater good, how it helps the natural organic harmonizing unifying progression of the Universe. (and as such, how much is the rest gonna harmonize with it, and thus help or hinder. Literally harmonic resonance with the outside.) Efficiency wrt the outside.
4. Belief
	All beliefs have energy systems that act like birthing chambers for the manifestation of the belief. Within these energy systems are currents that direct life experience. SO this one's basically resonance with the inside (that's really an addon to harmony, is not. Quite is worth the section)
5. Intent+Visualization. I'm thinking of conflating these two because they're so closely interrelated? not sure tho
	intent charges, imbues energy, and beliefs 
	intent is the channel of personal direction, the spin you yourself put on things. The envisioning, the creative effort, the outpouring of personal reality. The creation, the renovation of the personal universe, substituting reality. Creating what you visualize. Creating somethng new for the rest to resonate with. Overriding.
	only one is indirect and one is direct? really or maybe one is more abstract and the other more concrete. But both of them deal in terms of future diffrenet reality, in certain terms, new reality forged 
Intent AND Will, where will is just visualization of energies? mmm sounds correct, the shaping of energies at the raw level, of just emotion and subtle
6. Feedback. 
	Adjustments as it goes. Creation as change, and itself, changing. External feedback, or awareness and correction, or intuition. Possible use of altered states to achieve better perceptions of the matters at hand.
