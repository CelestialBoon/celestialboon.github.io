ypnosis as getting into an inner dialogue
gateway project
communication in thoughts images senses feelings metaphors
be transparent with yourself


1:58 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] So, I've bought a book on erotic hypnosis and started reading it.
[2:01 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] Reached an exercise on self hypnosis, and interesting thing that I noted was that I needed a clear and defined self-negotiation minute, where I was literally speaking to myself and listening to my own reactions, going through the process of defining what I will do and how, before letting myself enjoy this.(edited)
[2:03 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] This may come handy to those who are reluctant to do stuff. Sometimes you may need a negotiation and acknowledgement and consent from yourself to safely start.
[12:30 PM] PaulSD: @Purlox Church of $cientology
[12:32 PM] Purlox: Ahh, that
[1:08 AM] PrincessCadance: Someone give me a danger file to use
[1:09 AM] PrincessCadance: Quickly I want to test something nothing out with a none safe file on my selfie
[1:41 AM] Patchwork Dreams: that's a dumb idea
[1:55 AM] Moonbeam [Eden]: It’s GH policy to use them for safety purposes only. If you really, really want one, PM a safety team member.
[1:55 AM] Moonbeam [Eden]: And be prepared to explain how this helps safety.
[2:37 AM] PrincessCadance: Actual was wondering if any of the jade ones where left and want to test it out since hypnosis’s seems to do nothing for me other then put me to sleep am told am too strong willed
[2:45 AM] Abvieon {Alex}: Dangerous doesn't equate to more effective
[2:47 AM] PrincessCadance: no but be intresting to see if it works or makes me in to some mindless drone
[2:48 AM] PrincessCadance: its fine am sure if i look hard enough i can find one online and then ask someone here i trust to monitor me and see if something goes wrong
[4:35 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] I don't think that the ability and the skill to be hypnotised is opposed to having a strong will. This appears to be a common misconception, treating hypnosis as something that is made upon a person against their will.
[4:41 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] Also, if someone understands how hypnosis, and hypnotic state works, they will, probably, naturally stay away from anything that was made to suggest things they don't want. Simply because they care about themselves and their minds.
[4:49 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] I'd suggest to actually try some beneficial hypnosis practice. There are books to read, hypnotists to meet and work with, and your own mind with its particularities ripe for self-discovery and mastery - and there are people here that are more than willing to help with that, as long as you have patience, interest and can ask.
[4:53 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] And lastly, I'd repeat and say that entering a hypnotic trance is a skill that one develops, learns and discovers as they work with their interest. It's not a set in stone statement about if this or that hypnosis "works" "on me". Once you experience trance consciously and willingly and understand its power and joy, and get into your own particularities of what works with your mind, you'll be able to more easily, fully and willingly enter trance with different inductions used both here and in other places.(edited)
[4:54 AM] Eris: Getting there is freaking difficult though
[4:54 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] Was a bit too long and full of "morals". I apologize for the lecturing tone.
[4:56 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] It depends on your own mind-configuration. I'd say that hypnotic trance is the most natural and easiest state of existence to be in, with the mind actually working really hard to keep itself from falling into trance all the time.(edited)
[4:57 AM] Eris: You maybe right
If you speak about you
Not for me though(edited)
[4:57 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] You are correct. But - there are many angles to look at the same thing from.
[4:58 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] And i'm just suggesting an angle that may be useful to being more natural, casual and curious with trance, and therefore, falling into it more easily.
[4:59 AM] Eris: I dont see where there is a suggestion in that
[5:00 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] I don't know the truth about you. I barely touched what I know about myself. I admit it.
[5:01 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] There are different views about things, and some of them may be beneficial towards certain goals and some towards certain other goals.
[5:01 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] These two statements are ok with you?
[5:02 AM] Eris: Its not that
I just curious if i missed what you suggested
[5:02 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] Oh, ok ^_^
[5:02 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] Curiosity is a grand thing, btw. I adore curious people.
[5:06 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] (Thinking how to phrase it)
[5:10 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] And I failed. I don't think I'm capable now to express myself clearer than I did before.
[5:10 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] It depends on your own mind-configuration. I'd say that hypnotic trance is the most natural and easiest state of existence to be in, with the mind actually working really hard to keep itself from falling into trance all the time.
[5:13 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] I could get arguments to support this view, try to explain why it helps, or expand on this, but I think that my statement is pretty clear? Maybe we have a misunderstanding about what did we mean by "suggesting"? I meant nothing special besides presenting a point of view, which I did, and explaining how it may help, which I think I did.
[5:13 AM] Eris: Im not sure why you think that that state is natural in any way
[5:14 AM] Eris: Like
So many people have problems achieving it
Means its not
[5:14 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] Do you sleep?
[5:14 AM] Eris: Yes
[5:15 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] Is sleep, or even more, the state and the process of falling asleep are natural to you?
[5:16 AM] Eris: Yes o..o

Commentary
Metaphors can change our opinions in ways we don’t even realize
Emerging research tells us that a single metaphor can have consequences for how we think, and be powerful tools in the hands of those looking to shape our opinions.
[5:16 AM] PrincessCadance: intresting read
[5:16 AM] Eris: For fucks sake
[5:17 AM] Eris: We having a conversation
[5:17 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] Falling asleep is a certain hypnotic state, that is widely used for hypnotic inductions. And its totally natural.
[5:17 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] Do you space out sometimes?
[5:17 AM] Eris: Sometimes
During work >..>
[5:17 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] Let your mind wander? Loose track of time? Sometimes not thinking of anything at all really?
[5:18 AM] Eris: No that never works
[5:18 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] How do you space out then?
[5:18 AM] Eris: Im not sure
Just my attention slips sometimes and i forget things
[5:19 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] Nods This too, is a hypnotic state. It is used in different inductions to get to the same place of hypnotic trance.
[5:20 AM] Eris: Nice
Where do i find them?
[5:21 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] Would you agree, that on some level, we, or part of us, would be really happy if we were allowed to have dreams at work? To sleep-walk in the most casual of ways, without missing our attention or responsibilities, but just having this ability to... be there.
[5:21 AM] Eris: It would be nice
But its different when im actualy trying to relax
It
Just doesnt work
[5:21 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] And visit that place where we rest when we go to sleep, whenever we want to, fully and willingly
[5:22 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] So that's hypnosis for you. It is as natural as sleep or spacing out.
[5:22 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] And many more actually common states people encounter.
[5:23 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] Maybe you can see now what I meant when I said that the mind actually works really hard to keep ourselves out of it?
[5:24 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] You want to read about inductions?
[5:25 AM] Eris: You said that tje mind tries to keep on in that state, as far as i understood
[5:25 AM] Eris: Thats why i objected
[5:25 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] I corrected myself. Mistyped
[5:25 AM] Eris: Ahh allright
[5:26 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] Oh. So it was a misunderstanding on words ^_^
[5:28 AM] Eris: Yes
And i also object to the fact that just because we slip out of attention every now and then, that its some natural state
Because if it was, no one would have trouble achieving trance or effects of hypnosis
Its the exceptions(edited)
[5:31 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] Understood.
[5:31 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] I'm going to sleep now. Nice talking to you!
[5:31 AM] Ethanland Twibat Sparkle: It's possible for something to be easy to do unconsciously, but hard to do consciously
[5:32 AM] Eris: Good night Nekko
[5:32 AM] [Nekko/Dash/Fire/Lightning]: [Nekko] Goodnight, Eris
