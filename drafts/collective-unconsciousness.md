some piece on the collective unconsciousness
and the infantilism
and the responsibility
and language
and McNature
and the genetic mind
and the thoughts of others
and that others' self-hate
and the way empathy is related
and how this transcends time and space
and how this amounts to a species connection
and how this culminates in a single organism, one Mind
and what it means for the single: easier to come to one's senses, but requires commitment
it's the organizing, the harmonizing, instead of the individual effort
it's maintaining one's reality
it's spreading and connecting and making one aware of what's going on
it's feeling, it's realization, it's awareness, it's consciousness
