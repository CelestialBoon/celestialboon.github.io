Tulpamancing for depressed people:

well first it's kinda complicated

that stuck narrative, the need 

that motive or other

that present awareness that gets distorted

the stopping of the struggle. In the awareness of the present, things are let happen. Smallest pushed. 

Keeping the intent

curing depression as nurturing life

lots of love

[Hello. I have a question. How common is it for hosts to suffer from depression and loneliness?]
[And how common is it for hosts to become nonresponsive?]
[Like they gave up, can't hear them anymore, you're in control of their body, like they're... Gone? Do they sometime, kinda "retreat" to some deep corner of their mind when under intense stress?](edited)

Yeah. With depression it's easy to just want to shut down.  Things are weighing on you and you don't know how to deal.

[I got scared. I don't know what I'd do if Fairy Blue was truly gone... I hope he just shut down under stress and will come back soon...]

The way of dealing with that, well the best I've seen is basically the way that Buddhism instructs, particularly of the Zen variety. It's a, very large topic, but basically it's about shifting the responsibility off yourself, and this letting go of the stickiness to things and events and memories, for things change all the time, and so it's better to just focus on the present. And if it's a present of grief and suffering, it's still an experience that allows the person to process, to grow and move on.(edited)
it's the not shying away from the circumstances because they change and evolve, and so with experiencing the grief, we allow it to get past us. This too shall pass.
Admittedly for some this whole to and fro thing is lived at a lower average in mood than others, but the way I've made that jump in averages has been through a strong reevaluation of what the self really is, and that's a rather substantial topic

what my friend allways did to me was give me a day off and then prod me on the second day

Well you're definitely giving him more time to properly process it. When he comes to you to vent about it, do offer some recontextualization, some different point of view.

CelestialBoon - 06/07/2018
If he can't let go of it, then he can try and hold it from some other angle that's not as painful.
in cases such as this I find it useful to put some distance between me and the event by considering those experiences as they afflicted someone else, or at least similar experiences, and I were to offer some way to recontextualize them
to make sense of them in a larger scheme
so that's something that you can offer yourself, and especially prompt him to
