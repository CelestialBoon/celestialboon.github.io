## Opening about one thing
I've been thinking
and exploring
and tying it up to related concepts
and I think I've stumbled upon a superstructure

the thoughtforms and their behaviour

## explain the underlying concept
the different behaviours of astral space vs etheric space
the spaces vs the inbetween

the quality of experience, translucent vs opaque


resonance
novelty vs habit
ambiguity vs definiteness
sliding scale of concreteness
and the placebo vs the real medicine

and the zero point field

## extend it progressively to more spaces
imagination --- matter
creativity
and programming languages
and thoughtforms as in tulpas
and magic and its effects

## tie it up together semantically
the pursuit of realness, and the traces in language


## corollaries and applications


I think I've figured something out
I think that "astral" and "etheric", as the planes outside the physical are sometimes defined, are sort of better used as qualities, as part of a sliding scale of "concreteness"
in the sense that there's this quality of self-sustenance to tulpas, right? and more in general, that they gain concreteness/form/"reality" with time and attention and practice etc. and it's the same thing here
in the sense that there's some thoughtforms that will continue existing as they are if they're not fed as much attention/energy and others that will revert to a more primal nothingness instead
> Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.  
> Philip K. Dick
also the same thing; basically there's this concept of realness/concreteness/opaqueness, or of etherealness/translucence/ambiguity on the other end of the scale, that are a single sliding scale where astral and etheric also belong
it's the duality of unreal vs real but also of chaos vs order, where chaos as the primal source of creativity, and order as the established structure
and it's also the emptiness of space vs fullness of matter scale
> The vector equilibrium is the zero starting point for all happenings or nonhappenings; it is the empty theater and empty circus and empty Universe, ready to accommodate any act and any audience.  
> Buckminster Fuller
and of course it's also the same scale as novelty vs habit
and again, the stillness is the point from which everything may spring forth; it is the ultimate potential
and at the other end you have matter, which is potential realized to point of extreme entrenched-ness, habitual quality, and unresponsiveness
> Matter flings itself to the universe,  
> perfectly pitiless in its betrayal of soul.
so what happens here is all space of experience has this quality of astral-ness or etheric-ness, possibly in varying degrees, from the imagination being very volatile and fluid and creative to matter being as solid and unchanging as it gets
and in this sense, one could say that most dreams take space in astral places, to a degree
while a lot of magic is about punching through the astral spaces, which are called the inbetween spaces because they are so responsive to the individual that they have no identity of their own (talking in extremes here, but bear with me)
while instead places with *their* own identity are sought, their own "realness", their own ontology, instead of something that would allow the practitioner to be lost in a place of their own devising
and magic is about reaching those places of increased realness because it's what needs not be sustained with attention either, and that are able to exist more independently of the observer, so that's basically the stuff of the spells that work on other people without warning, basically
the more "astral" a spell is, the more it will not connect with someone who doesn't know/realize
so the placebo effect is basically on the astral side of "how shit works", while medicine by matter eg. drugs are at the other end, that of "etheric" realness
the key idea is that *both work*, like, both are legitimate states of existence, both are valid ways of curing someone, and indeed everything happens inbetween, but every point inbetween has validity, it just works in different ways
and besides, there's plenty of things progressing across the scale, like ideas starting from mere fancies to being progressively "fleshed out" and "realized"
or tulpas starting from tentative selves to self-sustaining beings
plus of course the reverse also happens
and it's this play between the place, the state where creativity resides and creation happens, and the creations themselves, which limitations can engender more creativity; the result of chaos is order and the result of order is chaos
and more, there's the litmus test of verifying something's concreteness by withdrawing the energy you are providing it and seeing if they glow of their own radiance, or if they fade into dormancy/nonexistence
and very much in general, observing+managing one's energy flow towards something/someone is very informative
and what happens when two people connect/resonate is that one's astral increasingly become the other's astral
meaning that ideas, thoughts, feelings etc, don't have to take on as much reality to be communicated/shared
and the inner spaces become more unified and coherent with each other's
it's the phenomenon of "*getting* someone at a deep level"
plus of course, every etheric thoughtform has astral offshoots, and so on, I think one way this happens is when a "signal" is only caught halfway ie. when you don't resonate exactly, and the rest of the blanks are filled with something that's more personal
PLUS, it is also true that realness is acquired by repetition, and this is not only about habit in time but also in space ie. quantity
so like, the more energy something has, the more "real" it is, like matter is insane quantities of energy that are densely packed
and the more you think of something the more it grows closer to realizing
plus of course, coherence is also a factor ie. focus, for bringing aggregation to happen in the most efficient way possible ie. by constructive interference
like, these concepts are nothing new but it's good to see them systematized in an overarching structure, you know
plus it's very interesting to contemplate the paradox, of how nothingness is in a very real sense the place of ultimate creativity, for nothing is disallowed, nothing is preferential, everything is equally possible
and from this single point of view, slants to this nothingness, deviations, distortions became necessary to explore more of what it means to create, effecctively
and how this is also contained in the very same process of bursting forth from nothingness
and how effectively when we look forward to creating, we do not look for the vastest creativity space we can afford, but on the contrary, to the *smallest*
the most restrictive creative space that still allows to bring forth what we had in mind within the parameters that we gave
bringing focus, reality, concreteness etc. to the venture
like, just looking at how those language pieces fit into this semantic structure is very satisfying in and of itself
but yeah, that's why there's this continuing seesaw between restrictiveness and openness; on one end it's making tools as precise, as calibrated to the imagined tasks as possible, as form-fitting as doable, both by making it easier to move things in the "right" direction eg. useful syntax and constructs, **and** making it harder to move in the "wrong" direction eg. error checking
and at the same time, the countervailing effort of pulling it back to more generic capabilities and more versatility and more open-endedness since new goals, new directions, new objectives are discovered by iterating on those very goals, and there's the need for new paradigms, new structures, new tools to accomodate new visions
and I think the ability to see things as laying on this spectrum, and using things laying at various points of it as demand requires, and being able to dance along it, is a possibly crucial skill. Programming teaches it in spades but it also applies eg. in any creative space, in magic, in the exploration of the inner existence, and so on and so forth
and I think that's what mastery is made of - the knowledge of those levels, and when to apply each; what level to put forward to approach what comes at you
