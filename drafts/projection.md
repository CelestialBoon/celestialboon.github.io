if you don't have frame of references for your own X, you will not be able to identify it in other people
like if you don't take care of your boundaries, then you will step over other people's because you lack the applied concept

the mind works by comparison and resonance

the mind is trapped in a hall of mirrors
and within it, it can experience itself and come to understand more
but this needs guidance, and that comes from the heart, for the heart has access to the frequencies of the outside, the heart can see beyond the box of the mind
the first step is to acknowledge projection and stop making it worse ie. treating your shadows as someone else/someone else's responsibility
projection can be used as a tool for development, since when taking ownership of the shadow, is when one can truly start putting their mind in order
even that though has to be at the service of the heart, because the mind is ill-fit to self-direct


it honestly looks like we're under some sort of curse that stops the mind from getting outside of itself. It genuinely feel that way sometimes
when we're so much "in our own heads" that we can't manage to see the other
head so far up one's own ass, and that means everything we associate with it, from being oblivious, stubborn, an asshole, and that comes from only seeing yourself
the self absorbed
in order to have good social relationships, you probably shouldn't do that, but that's not so easy to do when it presses so urgently on us, so the thing to do is instead acknowledge it and work with it.

life as a learning experience; if it's not literally set up as such, it still looks like the most useful paradigm to use, since what we end up seeing is exactly the stuff at our level of growth, immediately above us. There's lots that we take for granted, there's lots that we can't see, but what we see (in our live and others') is near our level of awareness, perfect for our incremental growth of consciousness if we take it that way.

projection as a tool for introspection and growth
people can be stuck on what to do, not know themselves that much, or what they want, or what they could do, or should do
and yet they're filled with opinions about others, and what they should do, and this and that
and the two are deeply interrelated

one method is to just think of someone but in some unfocused fuzzy way, just letting them be a mirror for your own stuff

everyone's got parts of the world that they don't like, stuff they don't like in people, but what hides behind these surface rejections is our road to growth
it's not about accepting everyone and everything into your life, just the opposite; but that which elicits strong feelings in you is something that calls out to be part of your life, one way or another, so that you find a new balance with it, and then do with it what's needed
such as bringing in something that you like, or resolving old-standing issues and then letting something go

the spiritual view is that what is outside ourselves is a manifestation, an incarnation of the inner, that is used in order to recognize, to differentiate, to act and to evolve. It's a projection of something that would otherwise find no expression 
we travel to experience ourselves. The world of experience is a projection of our inner world, that becomes perceivable, sensible, so that we can come to experience it, understand it, interact with it, and with this experience change, evolution, growth

the outside world is a projection of our inner world, because effectively the outer world doesn't exist per se to us; there is only the inner representation of the outer world. Everything that the senses present is necessarily filtered through our sensibilities
what we see in others is necessarily recognizing parts of ourselves in them. And when we are not neutral to that, it means we are not netural to ourselves; we disgust or excite or admire ourselves
the world manifests ourselves to us before we are ready to bear the weight of fully recognizing that as ourselves and owning it
The others are an immense complex universe, and what we can recognize and understand of them are seeing ourselves in them
it's the process of growth in which first we see what we are externalized onto the outside world, as as we learn to recognize it, experience it, deal with it, appreciate it, gradually we come to internalize it and it can become a fully integrated part of ourselves

It is a precious tool to understand ourselves, because we're often conditioned to show very select parts of ourselves through our actions, if not faking something that we're entirely not, and through performing this enough times, we might start to believe that's actually us, and in so doing, the projections we do towards others become full of those parts of ourselves that go unexpressed, unacknowledged, dispossessed, and unappreciated

walk in another's shoes as ways to truly empathize with them; to understand someone, we have to become them, in the sense that the more we share experiences, the more of a shared venn diagram we possess, the more we can see the other through ourselves. There are many parts and angles of others we don't know, and more still that we don't understand, and it takes a lot of awareness and courage to be able to feel out the edge of your understanding, where people's logic and motives venture in a territory that you haven't ever visited, the edge of comprehensibility

It is severely damaging to let this process go unobserved and unacknowledged
for example, there's countless people who fear success, and in recognizing success in others, they will fear it and can't bear it, and will try to suppress it, to move it out of their view, to make it disappear from their lives
there are many things that we just quietly try and sweep under the rug, collectively and individually speaking, simply because we cannot admit to ourselves that they are parts of ourselves, but neither that we acknowledge that this is the process through which these parts that aren't integrated yet come to manifest and prcoess towards integration. Through this lack of respect we do profound disservices to others and ourselves

the eyes are the mirror of the soul, and very aptly a mirror is a surface in which you see yourself reflected
the other is a way for teh Self to be known, in the sense that in the Other we see the Self reflected within

our tools of shame, judgment, are really something that are way too intense to throw around to other people. The inner landscape is something taht is way faster feedback and loose and responsive and elastic and can handle this much better. We can use strong tones with ourselves because deep down we understand ourselves enough for that. We can handle our feedback, we can handle our opinions; not so much that of other people, because other people cannot hope to tell the exact moment things change, and we need that kind of instant feedback to actually steer ourselves.
shame etc. are powerful tools that shouldn't be used without the cognition that what we are judging are really parts of ourselves, that we should look forward to integrate within ourselves one day, to properly reform and integrate

this externalization as a consequence of us running away from ourselves; as not recognizing this stuff as something we should work on personally, on ourselves. We cannot bear the burden of ourselves and externalize it all on others. We cannot bear the weight of each other's judgment and in so doing people condemn one another to a world of shame and shadows

shadow work says that that we cannot stand in other people is the shadow manifesting through others; what we idolize in others is our inner gold that we lend to other people, in wait for the moment when we take it back because we have grown enough to carry it ourselves.

we do this both for the positive qualities and the negative ones in ourselves (which happens because there's no true positive or negative qualities; it's all just parts of us, they all make us, it's just us), only we call the negative ones shadow and the positive ones inner gold, and of course we have very different behaviours when responding to our projections of either one: we recoil in disgust and judgment at our projected shadow, and we admire, idolize, even fall wildly in love with our projected inner gold.
(I say this with a picture of renamon on the side - this both to say that it's very often that we externalize our qualities on someone that's not physically close to us, but also that it's really good to keep one's inner gold close, it's lots of space for reflection and growth)
Renamon for me is naked radiance. It's graceful power and powerful grace, it's the solidness of responsibility lived as naturally as can be, not felt as a weight but as an essential component to life, something that life cannot exist without. It's looking at the future and walking towards it, with every breath being the carrier of the future. It's the embodiment of the real progress, that of the living of an empowered, thriving present. You'll quickly notice that this has little to do with Renamon and everything to do with me - that's entirely the point.)

Idols are necessary but it's also necessary to kill them ie. to let them go once the gold has been realized as inner and has been internalized. You will never see the idols for what they are as people, with their own lives and their issues and their inner life, instead seeing the projection. So this is not a sustainable state, and it inevitably leads to a state where the gold shifts, but for many this is lived as a process of disillusionment and abandonment of naiveté. Society is doing everyone a profound disservice in not being aware of this process, because then the natural process of letting go of one's idols is lived as a pathologic failure instead of a natural process of just coming back to see one person for what they are as a person instead of a projected ideal that has backwashed. Furthermore, acknowledging the inner gold projection process would do greatly to help people internalize it instead of having to shift the carrier every now and then.

It's a process that just takes people (not even much for themselves, for the important part is the projection others overlap on them) and uses them as something that they are not, and later lets them go for as arbitrary a reason as the taking, and they can take this devastatingly personally, but it's just the motion of a collective being in the process of figuring itself out.

to recognize the possibility, the energy within us, the possibilities, and once understood, having the understadning that they can be directed this or that way; either what is worthy or unworthy can be destroyed; either what is worthy or unworthy can be created.
One can create or destroy following a higher inspiration or not, it's never what one does, but the how and the why
One can instruct children, but doing it wrong leads to a mass of people bent into compliance and obedience, which is the opposite of what we should educate people towards, which is realizing themselves, letting them bring out their unique self in the best possible way for the benefit of the whole, not lock them into this or that path because of arbitrary choices made in formative years. We should unlock them, not lock them. Every step should open up to more possibilities and not restrict their choices more with each step of the path

When we look at people on the other side that project our shadow, that would be the best possible opportunity for us to understand how to treat that in a humane way. We should understand how to treat that humanely and kindly not just because one day we might be in that situation, but because we're already there. It's already ourselves on the other side, and the call to understand and help others is really a call to understand and help ourselves. And not just help the people that the media tells us to help, but what genuinely is in our lives and impacts them, what gives us genuine emotional engagement, instead of the manufactured one. Our emotional life is the burning crucible of our development.
We must follow our emotions in order to figure out our priorities in life

Anxiety as the felt urgency of development, something that was left behind and now pushes to catch up
Mourning process of realizing that 
> Sometimes this can be, like, a mourning thing, like, it can hit you how much time has passed since you were first aware of the issue until now, when you've internalized that it is an issue and that it's okay to consider it a disability (or however you choose to frame it), and to just... feel all that lost time, lost energy, lost opportunities, all at once. Because it wasn't truly lost until you realized it, it was just, like, a part of life.

the fear we feel about others, like they're risking x, can easily also be fears about ourselves. When we see practiced people do things and we fear for their failure, that's us projecting our own fears about the thing that they are doing, it's a feeling of needing to be better. Fears are in a sense a feeling of inadequacy, if temporary. All fear is a fear of inadequacy

the others are such a precious gift to ourselves. Through them we can experience ourselves in a billion ways

the mind is trapped in a self-reflecting hall of mirrors, while the heart is what really sees beyond this trap

not knowing this is a terrible curse.
there are so many people who lash out but they're only doing this at their own shadows, not realizing they are lashing at the projections they themselves cast, with nothing to do with the person they are dealing with. Which is how parents and adults end up transfering their own traumas and shadows over the impressionable children, by having them play the parts of the adults' shadows

the way to escape projection is from higher inspiration, listening to something that is above the level pov and comes from above, which is the voice of soul etc. like the stuff tha just comes and we just do it and it's not really something we fully understand but it works out
the boxed mind vs the free heart
> There's no freedom in the intellect. It's locked within a box within a box within a box. Only the heart can express the authentic self that is here in this world, living in this time, in this place, as you! If you have touched into this, then it will become your navigator.

being mad at people because they were exposing weaknesses in me. All for my own growth, and this emotions are really for me, because that signals me that I should do better; I should change my behaviour; I should have better boundaries; I should cut bad influences from my life; I should take better care of my mental landscape. I should pay more attention. I should do better than that.
Like that time with Simone (che ho descritto a chroma)
o con mio padre, che mi mostra che dovrei imparare ad essere indipendente dalle opinioni e comportamenti degli altri. Io sono il disadattato

there is a stark difference from the dispassionate action and that throwing emotion at people, which is much more often born out of shadow. You can fele yourself being centered while you act in the right way, instead unbalancing yourself when you don't

Robin Sharma — 'The mind is a wonderful servant, but a terrible master.'

“The intellect is a beautiful servant but a terrible master. Intellect is the power tool of our separateness. The intuitive, compassionate heart is the doorway to our unity.”
— Ram Dass

“Atto d’amore è accogliere in noi la nostra parte più ferita e fragile, accorgersi che dobbiamo amare l’ultimo degli uomini perché arriva terribile il momento in cui ci accorgiamo che l’ultimo degli uomini siamo noi.” - Carl Gustav Jung

To love someone else is easy, but to love what you are, the thing that is yourself, is just as if you were embracing a glowing red-hot iron: it burns into you and that is very painful.
Therefore, to love somebody else in the first place is always an escape which we all hope for, and we all enjoy it when we are capable of it.
But in the long run, it comes back on us.
You cannot stay away from yourself forever, you have to return, have to come to that experiment, to know whether you really can love.
That is the question-whether you can love yourself, and that will be the test.

“The acceptance of oneself is the essence of the whole moral problem and the epitome of a whole outlook on life. That I feed the hungry, that I forgive an insult, that I love my enemy in the name of Christ — all these are undoubtedly great virtues. What I do unto the least of my brethren, that I do unto Christ. But what if I should discover that the least among them all, the poorest of all the beggars, the most impudent of all the offenders, the very enemy himself — that these are within me, and that I myself stand in need of the alms of my own kindness — that I myself am the enemy who must be loved — what then? As a rule, the Christian’s attitude is then reversed; there is no longer any question of love or long-suffering; we say to the brother within us “Raca,” and condemn and rage against ourselves. We hide it from the world; we refuse to admit ever having met this least among the lowly in ourselves.” - Carl Jung

The most dangerous psychological msitake is the projection of the shadow onto others: this is the root of almost all conflicts. - Carl Jung

Life cannot be against you, for you are Life itself. Life can only seem to go against the ego's projections, which are rarely the truth. - Author: Mooji

I see how you look at me," spits the hateful man. He thinks we look upon him with the evil eye when we are not looking at him that way at all. We are just looking at him. It's because he can't accept the hate inside of himself that he projects it onto us. - Author: Kate McGahan

The sick person becomyhues very adept at distinguishing between compassion and pity. Compassion is someone else's suffering flaring in your own nerves. Pity is a projection of, a lament for, the self. All those people weeping in the mirror of your misery? Their tears are real, but they are not for you. - Author: Christian Wiman

The things we see are the same things that are within us. There is no reality except the one contained within us. That is why so many people live such an unreal life. They take the images outside them for reality and never allow the world within to assert itself. - Herman HEsse

“Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.”

If we see a sad rain, it doesn't mean the rain is sad, but it means we see it. That's an easily dismissible kind of projection.

What others say and do is a projection of their own reality.

"And certainly we should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality. It cannot lead, it can only serve; and it is not fastidious in its choices of a leader. This characteristic is reflected in the qualities of its priests, the intellectuals. The intellect has a sharp eye for methods and tools, but is blind to ends and values. So it is no wonder that this fatal blindness is handed from old to young and today involves a whole generation" - Albert Einstein


==================

Hey guys, I’m back! Today I’d like to demystify what projection really means, and nothing better than to tell some stories about it.

Well, first of all, we need to understand that our psyche has the tendency to split and dissociate. And precisely because of that, the phenomenon of projection is possible. Another thing is to realize that we’ll meet all contents of our soul first projected onto the outer world, and by relating to them, their integration is possible.

My dad was a pastor in a Christian church, needless to say, that growing up in that environment left its scares. The first was that we’re basically all a piece of shit, and without the grace of god we are doomed, lol. On a more serious note now, Christianity doesn’t have any representations of our emotional, instinctual, earthly, and Dionysian side. By relating solely to the Trinity and the masculine aspect, we neglect our feminine and natural side.

Half of us is completely shattered, and we lose our humanity.

We learn that sex is a sin and every desire we possess makes you an evil being that needs to ask for forgiveness. Obviously, people need to keep their urges in check, so they become even more dogmatic, repressing, even more, their true self. Well, this fanatical behavior actually has its roots in major doubt, they secretly feel that if they can convert people their doubts will cease.

Dogmas can also have another interesting effect. We learn that the Christian god is pure, has absolutely no evil, and is benevolent, it’s one-dimensional. If we look at Hinduism, for instance, they have Shiva, which is the “destructive” side of god. Anyway, as Christians, we learn to project evil outside of us, onto the devil. So, if you go really deep in it, every sinful desire you may possess is actually caused by an external source.

Emotions are so repressed that you can’t recognize them inside you, only outside. And when something is unconscious it always acquires a bizarre, compulsive, and “possessive” quality.

That’s where things start to go sour.

The first step of projection is actually IDENTIFICATION. You can’t accept that you possess such instincts, so you start to see evil in everyone that possesses a different faith, or is actually acting upon their feelings. When you’re in this level things get really twisted, it’s as if you’re seeing the world through these devilish lenses, a happy couple can look evil simply because they aren’t married.

And this is the most dangerous level, that’s why we have so many wars, prejudice, sexism, and racism. Instead of facing your own soul, you try to destroy your inferiorities on the outside.

At a young age, I’d learned to despise girls that were sexually active or anyone that didn’t possess the same faith. I had absolutely no awareness. It reached a point where my soul was so repressed that I was feeling constantly anxious and depressed. Suddenly something inside me couldn’t take it anymore, and I just rebelled against everything.

I started to figure things out by myself, and I learned that I was also capable of being evil, and I even may have gone through some dangerous paths…

It’s only when you start to recognize and accept that you also possess the contents you’ve been seeing onto other people, that the spell starts to break and you reach the PROJECTION level. Once you face your shadow you begin to bring its contents to the light of consciousness, thus integrating and transforming them.

When you’re able to accept that you’re capable of being evil and consciously choosing not to be and differentiate what really belongs to you, and what belongs to other people then you’re maturing.
