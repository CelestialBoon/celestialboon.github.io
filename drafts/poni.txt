<image of Celestia>

Looking at S1 Celestia, the only one of two alicorns in the whole realm, thousand-year-running ruler of Equestria, tall and imposing, with powers beyond that of any mere pony, which she uses to maintain the cycles of the very heavens... it's not hard to imagine that she would be treated as a bona-fide goddess by most ponies. In fact, this sort of treatment even escapes Applejack's lips in S1E9 "Bridle Gossip" when she exclaims "Thank Celestia!"

Thing is that Celestia actually has more than a passing resemblance to an actual goddess of Gnostic import: the goddess *Sophia*, whose name is wisdom.

Sophia is (reputed to be) the Gnostic evolution of the neolithic spiritualities that would venerate the Mother Goddess, the source of fertility, of life, of plenty; a goddess that often <i>is</i> the Earth herself. Similarly, Sophia is a goddess that is embedded in the Earth, of which the Earth is the material feeling body; she is Mother Nature. A similar figure is also found in late pagan spiritualities, from the Greek <i>Gaia</i> to the Egyptian <i>Isis</i> to the Roman <i>Magna Mater</i>.

It is to note that effectively all the disparate neolithic and pre-neolithic spiritualities had at the center of their worship powers that were fully manifest and living among men. The bounty of Nature, the radiance of the Sun, and so on, were immediately apparent and considered direct manifestation of the Divine, and they provided the matrix in which people lived and thrived.

While we don't reach quite that same level of involvement in the show, the physical presence of a goddess-level being among ponies does certainly provide them with a very grounded sense of awe and of the sacred. It is fairly difficult not to classify the relationship between Celestia and her subjects as at least not partly spiritual.

But let's go a little deeper. 

Pagan spirituality had a very different sensibility to it than modern religions, which possess vastly more remote and stand-offish gods, taking on a very removed role from the day-to-day life of the individual; instead, the pagans of old would live a spirituality that was permeating every hour of their life, and that gave them a strong sense of the lived sacred; a life in which spirits lived among men and gods managed the world together with people; a world in which every plant, every animal was part of the sensory body of a goddess, or at least was part of the domain of some spirits or others. A world of Muses, of daemons, of gods that would just speak inside people's heads in order to counsel, guide, and inspire.

Sophia herself actually had a presence to her which transcended the mere physical presence as the planet Earth: the initiates in the Gnostic Mysteries were able to witness her in a truer form, the Organic Light.

> The Organic Light is a substantial opalescent haze, not a transparency. Both Pagan and Asian (Tantric) sources compare it to palpable moonlight or nacre, mother-of-pearl. Encountering the Light, and to some extent entering it, initiates entered the presence of the White Goddess whose body is formed of “vivid coruscations of light, and cloud piled upon cloud.”

A notable similarity is that the colors that Celestia wears are pretty much exactly that of mother-of-pearl, from the milky white base to the soft pinks, greens, purples and blue tones. While it is very possible that Celestia's palette has been directly inspired by mother-of-pearl, it nonetheless remains a noteworthy connection.

There is also to mention that the revelatory contact with Sophia also had very important repercussions on the individual.

> The purpose of initiation was implicit to its method: to behold “the Light of Instruction, ineffable and nameless,” and to learn both sublime and practical things from that encounter. Initiates learned how to coevolve with the earth goddess Sophia and guide human potential to its highest level of actualization.

The primary reason for encountering the Organic Light was to receive personal divine guidance, so to help the initiate find their true place in the world and contribute at their best to a better world.

This continues to happen to this day. Countless people with experience of spiritual practices can recount of their experiences with either Sophia or Gaia, and of the wisdom she has tirelessly imparted into them.

Not only her close association with the Sun imparts Celestia a radiance comparable with Sophia's Organic Light, but she is also shown playing a similar part on the day-to-day. The most obvious example is with her student Twilight Sparkle, which she has not only overtly mentored in the ways of magic, but also subtly prodded through little more than an invitation to "make some friends" in Ponyville in order to guide her to restore the Elements of Harmony and redeem Nightmare Moon, the greatest evil of the realm. 

Both are benevolent, overseeing Goddesses of Light who provide effective mentorship and guidance, with a deep-seated interest in helping their subjects fulfill their innate potentials, and in managing their realm to provide harmony and peace.

Though, as it happens with symbols and metaphors, Celestia's figure and presence are a more understandable translation for the Western palate: she is a localized entity which operates in ways close to our current knowing, such as working within the trappings of society. By contrast, Sophia's presence is vastly more widespread, but also more subtle, and requiring both a sensitivity and a sensibility that are not commonly cultivated in Western culture.




Princess Celestia and Sophia, the Mother Goddess

celestia: mentor, elder, subtle guider, validator
anything but a common pony, only one of two until S2
the Goddess cult AND the sun cult
enigmatic but very attentive and very intuitive, implicitly offers challenges to ponies for them to overcome. Very subtle mentor
elder, wise sage 
mentor, being able to both instruct and challenge

the Magna Mater, the Goddess, the fertility cults and suchlike, all the depictions of the Mother

goddess of nature, motherhood, fertility, creation, destruction, or who embodies the bounty of the Earth.

It was not a matter of belief in a higher power located somewhere beyond this world, off-planet, but an experiential faith in our connection to the divine power that is here, fully earthbound, providing the matrix in which we live, move, and have our being.

earth mother Gaia and sky father
but the female goddess has come close to the concept 

a complex character
immediate rimando a mother goddess, and the tipical diarchy of the main gods (earth mother/sky father, tho) 
but she's plenty more than that, she's got masculine elements, which is the mentoring part, and the sun

femininine (stewardship of the land) and masculine (stewardship of the Sun)
the Goddess cults of Neolithic times, of shamanism and animism

goddess Sophia, whose name is wisdom,
Celestia is their goddess, to the point of figuring in their swearing (AJ's Thank Celestia)

> In his introduction to G. R. S. Mead’s Fragments of a Faith Forgotten, American poet and culture critic Kenneth Rexroth proposed that Gnosticism grew from the prehistoric matrix of Goddess worship in Europe, “Neolithic and even earlier.” Emphasis on “the descent of the redeemer goddess” accounts for “the strong matriarchal or at least anti-patriarchal emphasis of most Gnostic sects.”13 In this perspective, the Mysteries were the natural outgrowth of the indigenous, Goddess-oriented shamanism of pre-Christian Europe, described by Marija Gimbutas, James Mellaart, Alexander Marshak, Merlin Stone, Stan Gooch, Robert Graves, Riane Eisler, and others.14

Celestia does mentoring, Sophia does instruction in appearance
Initiation in the Mysteries involved a direct encounter with the Sophianic intelligence, that is, “earth wisdom” in New Age parlance.

--------

a truly good place, where the greatest evil is the result of a very human error that spirals out of scope and transforms good-willing beings into monsters (pagan theory of error)
a world where the innate goodness in ponies has an easy time shining through, and the missteps are addressed by a solid community

a land protected by what is effectively a benevolent Goddess, Celestia (throwback to the spirits of the lands), and pagan gods)  

the land of plenty
Heslod the Greek poet describes the world of the Golden Age, before the Fall:
"Man lived like gods, without vices or passions, vexation or toil. In happy companionship with divine beings, they passed their days in tranquillity and joy, living together in perfect equality, united by mutual confidence and love. The Earth was more beautiful than now, and spontaneously yielded an abundant variety of fruits. Human beings and animals spoke the same language and conversed with each other."

land of magic, and that which we have lost and a few brave souls venture to recover, of the unknown 

land of caretaking the land, like natural agriculture, like the native americans, creating paradise
a deep relationship with nature, if pushed very far
a mutual symbiosis
rain rituals and such

land of community, of pony communities and everyone knowing everyone

land of friendship, of the strength of groups and learning from the adventures together

a land that feels good to us, and that makes us believe in a better world than what they tell us
gives people good feels because the voice inside reflects our view outside, and unless we believe in a good world, the voice inside us won't be good, because it's trying to warn us of it

swarm of the centuries -> pinkie as the one that knows
feeling pinkie keen 
zecora and pinkie as the shamanic archetypes

--------------

the community and the communal rituals (winter wrap up), keeping itself together through communal efforts, and what we have lost

-----------

on friendship
friendship as the most important thing, because it is through relating to others that we can evolve in our next leg of the journey
frienship is a wondrous and powerful thing
peace and love
supernatural threats nonwithstanding, the lessons are all very human, very ground-level and practical
