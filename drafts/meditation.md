# An introduction to meditation

The practice of directing awareness in a relaxed fashion, and letting the rest happen.

direction of attention
you are not the mind, you are the awareness, the consciousness
and one thing that it does is the direction of said awareness, the attention, that one's on you exclusively
and then the fading of the rest
this whole, controlling everything and controlling nothing

that removal of the ego like being in control of nothing and yet everything. Like really, that feeling. The dissolution of the fulcrum so you're the whole thing. the cessation of the singular focus

Well it works basically like this. The basis of both lucidity and most of the energetic (ergo, occult) work is based on increased awareness, and that comes from the ability to consciously direct the attention, in having increased mastery of it. And the main way to accomplish this is meditation.

Meditation is the practice of directing attention, but without forcing it. It's much like seeing, you just point the eyes somewhere and they observe; you don't have to force it, just direct it, and redirect it in case there's a distraction.

In very much the same way, it works for meditation. You have the ability to put your attention somewhere, so you practice putting it somewhere in particular for a length of time.

The main point of focus is usually the breath (and that's anapana sati). Just set a timer and watch the breath as it goes in and out (you cal let it go and have it become automatic too. You can let it breathe you). \

If you feel like dozing off, you can let the awareness expand to more parts of the breath, like the sensation on the nostrils, and on the windpipe, in the lungs, etc. Feel the motion, the texture, the temperature, and so on. All very naturally following from the simple act of directing the attention (again, just like pointing the eyes somewhere).

And of course, if you distract yourself, if thoughts happen or sensations happen or whatever happens, the point of the exercise is to direct the attention so you just point it at the breath as steadily as the moment allows. It's something of a relaxed exercise; nothing needs to be forced.

A key point to internalize is that thoughts don't matter. You are not the thoughts, much like you're not the sensation of clothes on your skin. So there's no obligation to pay them attention; they can happen and they can pass, and that's just fine. Your attention is somewhere else.

---------------------------------
If the autopilot won't manage, you can always integrate what you have to put your attention towards into the practice; either gain passive awareness of the surroundings as part of it (and one good thing to keep in mind is that placing the boundary of self at the skin is arbitrary)

or for the more active stuff, just integrate it, a bit like a freestyle dancer or a jazz artist that just work with what they have in the moment; eventually you can just return to the singular point of focus (like the breath for example)

--------------------
for one there's usually a very large autopilot that can take care of things as long as it gets the inputs (ie. you don't look elsewhere, and even then it's manageable through noninterference)

but at the core, meditation practice is the focusing of attention. If you completely direct your attention at your senses as you walk, and keep it there, that's meditation. It's what any and all awareness meditation does, you just direct the attention to some thing or other (usually part of the body or some event of it) and the practice is in keeping it there, at least at the base levels.

as you do this you can get to realize that a vast majority of events just, happen. Without the need for any conscious direction of them through thoughts.

so you can get to progressively relax your grip on things, knowing that it isn't needed, and just be in awareness.
