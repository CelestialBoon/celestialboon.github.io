But yeah
CelestialBoon - Yesterday at 12:20 PM

Thoughtforms are basically thought, concept loops. Information that is self-hosted and self-updating, consciousness/energy soliton. acting on the world through itself, by resonance. As soon as they stop acting, the loop is broken, and it joins a larger movement.

this whole Mind part, and the mind is populated with thoughtformst

thoughtforms as the patterns of reality
what the One Mind sees


[8:17 PM] Satra: Explaining the way my mind works would be really difficult. I don't mind thinking of it as "split mind" because that's how it feels a lot of the time. I can have conversations with different parts and versions of myself with little effort. I've talked about the idea of holding beliefs in superpositions here because that's how I experience it. I can easily move from one side of the spectrum to the other on a belief if it is necessary.

[8:19 PM] Satra: It's not indecisive in my mind, it's practical. I know enough to know that what we experience as reality is probably wrong to some degree. But the beliefs we choose to hold help us interact with it. I don't see a problem with holding different worldviews simultaneously. I find it very beneficial in making decisions and learning about those around me and myself.

[8:20 PM] Tammy: Well I think you have a beautiful mind!   ðŸ§ 

[8:20 PM] Satra: Thank you.

[9:31 PM] CelestialBoon: @Satra oh geez finally someone else that admits it :smile: Like, I've been exploring the idea of partial beliefs for a long time (even wrote something about it), and like, between tulpamancy and some really high ayahuasca experiences, there is a very definite knowing that it is very possible to embrace all kinds of levels and/or points of view about something, like say, it can be true at all levels that we are the body/the mind/the spirit/the Source etc. like, all are true at the same time. It's like saying that that a statue is marble and a statue is a man and a statue is a symbol of something

[9:31 PM] Satra: I live in too many realities to belief the same thing in all of them.

[9:32 PM] CelestialBoon: oh yeah, like, wow I've defintely felt that very much on my skin ever since ayahuasca

[9:32 PM] CelestialBoon: or even during hypnagogia

[9:32 PM] CelestialBoon: or just that meditative trance states where it's just a different shape to things, a different reality

[9:32 PM] CelestialBoon: I guess some people use that space for spirit invocation for one?

[9:33 PM] CelestialBoon: like, well, in shamanism I guess that's the spirit world or similar, but like, I kind of do a very light version of that? tulpamancy teaches very wild things once you start looking at it from a more spiritual lens

[9:35 PM] Satra: I don't do any tulpamancy stuff but I understand the ideas of what you're saying. I'm not sure what to say though honestly, haha.

[9:36 PM] CelestialBoon: yeah like, from what I observed tulpamancy is basically a layman's window into spirit work to be completely honest

[9:36 PM] Satra: Interesting.

[9:37 PM] Satra: I've never heard it described that way.

[9:37 PM] CelestialBoon: yeah like, there's plenty of people eg. in the tulpamancy community who just deal with entities on the regular, and it's like, seamless

[9:38 PM] Satra: Makes sense.

[9:39 PM] CelestialBoon: which tbh very much encourages me to think of a general theory of Mind, and what is experienced, what is recognized as separate, as thoughtforms, very much in general

[9:40 PM] CelestialBoon: so like, this is kind of the basis of chaos magick in a sense, for one, just using whatever framework you like to inbue your actions with particular intents. Letting thought shape action in the One Mind

[9:40 PM] CelestialBoon: and of course there's dealing with entities there and well, the notion of thoughtforms has gone plenty around in the occult circles before I thought up any of this, esp the chaos magick circles

[9:41 PM] Satra: I can understand that. Yeah, I've seen thoughtforms mentioned often but never actually looked into it.

[9:41 PM] CelestialBoon: it's kind of like, a more general theory of spirits, in a sense. It's kind of like saying that rectangles are polygons

[9:42 PM] CelestialBoon: higher category of things that collects manifestations of mind, self-sufficient and not alike

[9:42 PM] CelestialBoon: like, spirits, tulpas, sigils, but even just, thoughts, objects, etc. Any sort of something that the mind identifies

[9:43 PM] Satra: Hmm. Interesting.

[9:43 PM] CelestialBoon: and that is kind of, put at the basis of reality as seen from the perspective of the One Mind

[9:43 PM] Satra: What is the One Mind?

[9:43 PM] CelestialBoon: it's basically one way to see our collective existence as the life of a single organism, or Source

[9:43 PM] CelestialBoon: that experiences itself through us

[9:43 PM] CelestialBoon: the One dreaming Itself into Many

[9:44 PM] Satra: I like that idea.

[9:44 PM] CelestialBoon: yeah and like, there's the dream metaphor that can do a lot of work in this regard

[9:45 PM] CelestialBoon: especially considering the fractal nature of such an arrangement

[9:45 PM] CelestialBoon: in the sense that the Source, the One Creator, creates creators in turn, over and over

[9:45 PM] CelestialBoon: and in this sense we're able to imagine, dream, create, etc.

[9:46 PM] CelestialBoon: reproduce, even

[9:46 PM] Satra: Interesting conceptualization.

[9:47 PM] CelestialBoon: it's massively fascinating for one, and for another it's done me a lot of work

[9:47 PM] CelestialBoon: not to mention it's made my ayahuasca journeys very intelligible hah

[9:49 PM] Satra: Oh, I get it. I think that even though I don't have a language to put to truly describe my idea of Divinity, that definition gets very close.

[9:52 PM] CelestialBoon: mmm yeah like, yeah that's basically as close I can get myself

[9:53 PM] Satra: Thanks for trying to put it into words for me. :)

[9:53 PM] CelestialBoon: oh you're very welcome ^^ it's a pleasure sharing such theories for me

[9:54 PM] Satra: This is the first server that I've seen people be so open about their experiences and as such I've been able to find commonalities with people where as with other servers I tend to not be able to relate to many people in it. It's really amazing.

[10:20 PM] Void: Reminds me of a book I read about the theory that all Matter is a projection of underlying information.

It's honestly the single most quantum-mechanics-compatible of Physics theories.

[10:20 PM] CelestialBoon: man, you wanna see some wild underlying theory of reality

[10:21 PM] CelestialBoon: go browse r/holofractal

[10:21 PM] CelestialBoon: it's absolutely mesmerizing

[10:21 PM] CelestialBoon: the theory that is

[10:22 PM] Void: That sounds descriptive enough for me to be interested.

Life IS full of fractalization, and the holo aspect sounds like it has a lot in common with that info-projection

[10:22 PM] Void: pure assumption, of course

[10:23 PM] Void: thanks, will check it out

[10:23 PM] CelestialBoon: :thumbsup:

[10:23 PM] CelestialBoon: It's a wild ride


Thoughtforms are basically thought, concept loops. Information that is self-hosted and self-updating, consciousness/energy soliton. acting on the world through itself, by resonance. As soon as they stop acting, the loop is broken, and it joins a larger movement.
Also the universe is transforming and evolving so anything that is not self-modifying is risking something or other, especially if not anchored because chaosss theooryyyy

From this, a sigil is just a thoughtform that is imprinted in shape through symbol, as convenient anchor both for external focus and in purpose+functioning.
An entity is a thoughtform that is external and does whatever.
A single spell is a smaller loop that possibly ends up as add-on to things, designed to discharge, highly formulaic to aid the formation of the pure subltle components.
TUlpas are thoughtforms residing in the mental plane, mostly? but of course they can be shunted elsewhere, or they can learn themselves after a while

Basically any type of external add-on can be replaced by a mental one as soon as one recognizes its vibratory qualities. What they do wrt that. Replicating the vibrations is replicating the effect, the very essence of the action. Megamanning, wooo

Possible getting to rely on existing muscle memory of the world, the morphogenetic fields, like it gets easier for a door to be swung because it's been done already and it's what it's thought for, etc.
