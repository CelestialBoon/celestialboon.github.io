Presence of First source
consciousness
intelligence
Love
Force

creation as vibration

soul as the fragment of FS
imbued with the vibration
channel of love
but source itself is love, and it is encoded into soul as purest vibration
and consciousness is what source is, so soul is a reflection of that, and the vibration is also love
so basically soul is a particular vibration, which is love


so intelligence is consciousness is energy is vibration




so like

soul as fragment of FS
vibration love consciousness intelligence

and that invitation of soul is the invitation of love
the practice of love is the outpour of soul

and so the reason it works so well is because it bestows divine intelligence unto things

breath of life is breath of divine intelligence etc

--------

consciousness is love

love is intelligence is organizing chaos is consciousness 	

all is consciousness is vibration is intelligence by the simple way of interaction, it produces more

Source Intelligence, the presence of Source and the Intelligence of Source and the Love of Source

Love as the prime manifestation of Source through Source Intelligence
Source as consciousness, and so everything is consciousness, everything is intelligence, everything is vibrations, everything is degrees of love

soul as the shard of Love that is each slightly different
for there i

SNIPPETS

pure, connective energy, which is, in essence, divine love-intelligence.

your soul’s workshop, adding your fingerprint of love

Source is Symphony in every moment of time. Source is not an entity—IT is a Symphony of intelligent vibration.

I am a fragment of First Source imbued with ITS capabilities

Each individuated consciousness is a fragment of the beautiful mosaic that depicts the personage of First Source.

The individuated consciousness of the entity is the fragment of Prime Creator that is seeking to be remembered within the human instrument. It lives in an eternal state of nowness and represents the continuity of time and consciousness across all dimensions of reality.

The entity model of consciousness encompasses the individuated spirit sometimes referred to as the Higher Self or Soul. The entity is, in a sense, a fragment of the Universal Spirit Consciousness of Prime Creator. It is composed of a very refined and pure energy vibration that is equal to Source Intelligence (spirit).

The tone of equality emanates continuously from First Source. And because our Sovereign Integrals are individualized fragments of First Source, the Sovereign Integral also emanates this tone, or vibration of equality. The Sovereign Integral reflects this tone as part of its nature.

This vision is spaceless and timeless, it is eternal and therefore resides and emanates from First Source, a fragment of which exists within each and every one of us. And this fragment is expressed through the Sovereign Integral.

the ultimate realization of the inmost self as a God-fragment connected to all other God-fragments regardless of form.

holy FUCKING shit
consciousness is love

Cadey~ Today at 5:07 AM
that good?

CelestialBoon Today at 5:07 AM
so when we share Love we are sharing the consciousness of Source
we are literally sharing the intelligence of Source
no wonder it works so well in tulpamancy
we are literally letting Source figure shit out
`If you hold a thought of me,
imbue it with the expression
of your purest love
and your thought 
will be mine in that moment.`
and soul being the purest fragment of Source Reality
which is Love, again. Soul is a fragment of Love/Source Consciousness
when we feel Love we feel what soul feels. We hear what soul says, we perceive what soul sees.
because the presence of Love is the presence of soul.
So it's just fuckin' mathematical that saturating the instrument with Love equates to inviting soul within it
like I cannot say it enough, thinking with Love is thinking as soul.
and sharing Love with thoughtforms is animating them with the intelligence of Source
much like the breath animates matter
because it's the same thing

OTHER QUOTES

> The art of the genuine is called an art for a reason. It is not rational like mathematics where you have symmetrical energy input and output. You are opening your consciousness to a field of intelligence that surrounds you at all times. You are attracting this intelligence into your three-dimensional life as a co-creative force. **This co-creative force is potent, dynamic, and miraculously intelligent.**

First Source is a consciousness that inhabits all time, space, energy, matter, form, intent; as well as all non-time, non-space, non-matter, non-energy, non-form, and non-intent. It is the only consciousness that unifies all states of being into one Being. And this Being is First Source.

---

When all manifestations of life are genuinely perceived as fragmentary expressions of First Source, the vibration of equality that underlies all life-forms becomes perceptible to the human instrument. Life initially emerges as an extension of Source Reality, and then, as an individuated energy frequency invested within a form. It vibrates, in its pure, timeless state, precisely the same for all manifestations of life. This is the common ground that all life shares. This is the tone-vibration of equality that can be observed within all life forms that unifies all expressions of diversity to the foundation of existence known as First Source. If an individual is able to look upon any form of life with the outlook of equality, then they are observing Source in all things.

---

The Eternal Watcher is the only real interpretive center for the entity. It is the only stable guidance system that can propel the entity to its wholeness. Thus, the entity is composed of both the formless identity of Source Intelligence and the formful identity of densified energy. While the formless is one, the formful is divested in many fragments of expression that isolate its consciousness as islands of perception and expression. This condition results in the entity’s denial of its vast and glorious nature of existence.

---

Throughout the cosmos there is life—the expression of First Source in individuated form. These are the divine fragments that are always in the process of separating to experience individual expression of self, and congealing to experience universal expression of First Source. We are born from the very womb of the cosmos, and it is here that all will return in time. It matters not when or how. It only matters why.

---

It is the very nature of First Source to create innumerable fragments of itself and lead each to cohesion as a master organism, while allowing each fragment to retain its sovereignty. This is the perfect bestowal of love.

---

Evolution in the material universe has provided you with a life vehicle, your human body. First Source has endowed your body with the purest fragment of ITS reality, your Wholeness Navigator. It is the mysterious fragment of First Source that acts like the pilot light of the human soul—fusing the mortal and eternal aspects. Can you fathom what it means to have a fragment of the Absolute Source indwelling within your very nature? Can you imagine your destiny when you fuse with an actual fragment of the First Source of the Grand Universe? No limit can be placed upon your powers of Selfhood or your eternal possibility.

Each time we undertake a cycle of awakening, Deep Dive, and truth-telling, we learn something new about our energetic responsibility. We learn that we are an encompassing energy first and foremost. What is built from this energy in the form of the human instrument is not our authentic self, nor is it permanent or causal. We learn that energy is closer to who we are and that this energy is not defined by time-space. This energy level is at a deeper level, is intelligent and able to operate as a “Sub-God” or carrier signal of First Source.

---

In fact, my own words now lead me to point out a fascinating characteristic of these six “ordinary” words—they are intelligent fields of energy. Each one of us has been given a complete set of these intelligences as part of our soul’s equipment. These intelligent energy fields are our link to God, or what Lyricus refers to as First Source.

---

> Source Intelligence is the energy-consciousness of First Source that is cast into all worlds, all dimensions, all realities, all life forms, all times and places. Source Intelligence, in effect, is the “eyes and ears” of First Source, and its role is principally involved in expressing, upholding, and sustaining the will of First Source. On a more personal level, it is a liberating force of energy-intelligence that serves to accelerate the expansion of consciousness and assist those who desire to delimit themselves.

---

> In the human world, love is thought to be an action or feeling, not a form of high intelligence. The love of which I speak is the highest intelligence of the multiverse, but also the most misunderstood in the human domain. The human soul is a conduit of this love, or intelligence, and First Source is releasing higher energetics of this love frequency

---

> There is a vast interconnection, not only between humans, but between all particles of existence. And this interconnection is intelligent, communicative, and part of a Designing Force that we all exist within.

---

> **Understanding**: At the subtle levels, this virtue is focused on a specific awareness that First Source (Higher Intelligence) surrounds our fellow beings as a field of consciousness and that this consciousness unifies us.
>
> **Humiility**: The soul’s expression of love is its most important purpose while embodied within the worlds of time-space. It circulates this delicate, sublime frequency of love to the human body and mind without condition or motive. It will come as no surprise that it finds the heart a more willing collaborator than the mind. Humility is the realization that the heart, mind and soul co-mingle in the grace of a Higher Intelligence or Designing Force, and that their very existence is upheld through this connection of unconditional love.

---

> There is a First Source or Central Sun. All dimensions lead to it. Whatever name you give to it: Higgs Field, Source Intelligence, Spirit, it issues from the Central Sun as love and it dimensionally shifts universes via its intelligence. Yes, love is powerfully intelligent. It has an intelligence that shines so bright that it is the light we see on every dimension of consciousness. Love, at this core frequency of Spirit, connects to your personal self through your innermost, energetic heart. It passes in to you and through you at this juncture.

---

> The six heart virtues are the “rooms” in the home of love. They are not word-concepts; they are behaviors. The acquisition of behavioral intelligence is the task each of us is performing day-to-day whether we realize it or not. It is what life brings. We are all learning to forgive, to be humble, to express compassion, to be empathic and understand the other’s point of view, and so on. These are the qualities of love, and if we can pay attention to the branches of love, then love is expressed more completely in our lives.
>
> This is the equivalent of consciousness, because consciousness is love. Thus, if you want to bring more of your Self—your consciousness—to this reality we call human life, then the six heart virtues and their expression, is a good way to do it.

> Teacher: [...] The heart is also the gateway to the compassion frequency of love—the purest force of the multiverse.
>
> Student: I’ve never heard of this before. What do you mean by the compassion frequency of love?
>
> Teacher: Love, like all things dimensional, can be separated into a spectrum of frequencies—each frequency a part of the wholeness, but each possessing a different intelligence.
>
> Student: Intelligence?
>
> Teacher: Are all forms of love the same?
>
> Student: Of course not.
>
> Teacher: Love imbued with compassion and understanding is different from love that is stubborn and selfish, is it not?
>
> Student: Yes… but I don’t think of it as a difference in intelligence in the love itself, but rather the person expressing it.
>
> Teacher: That is because you don’t understand that emotions have an embedded intelligence based on their frequency and how the frequency resonates with the higher circuits of the multiverse.
>
> Student: I don’t understand.
>
> Teacher: Think of the multiverse as eleven holographic spheres of consciousness, each interpenetrating the one that is more inward. Only the outer sphere contains all spheres, and this is the consciousness of First Source, while the innermost sphere is the consciousness of inanimate objects like a stone or seashell.
Love is separated into frequencies that resonate in harmony with each of these “spheres” or domains of consciousness. Similarly, the heart itself consists of different layers of consciousness, and each “layer” has an intelligence of perception and expression. This intelligence is linked to the brain and higher mind, so that the human instrument is capable of expressing from any dominant frequency or sphere of the multiverse.

> Student: Including the level of First Source?
>
> Teacher: Yes.

purest fragment of its reality

`If you hold the thought of me,
imbue it with the expression 
of your purest love
and your thought 
will be mine in that moment.`
