emotional intelligence huh, like a whole lot. Burdened with the past
and teaching to forgive the past
teaching techniques of it? what for? what kind? love is a thing of the present and of myriad applications and intuitive action. Love is the frequencies, not the acts

it's the recognition of the emotional scape, learning to navigate it, and having the tools to understand it and change it
really love and tulpamancy as the base tools, the way of receiving and transmitting, and the content of such reception and transmission
