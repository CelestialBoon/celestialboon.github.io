procrastination and the feeling you should be doing someting else, the paralysis of perfection

the guilt biled up and the frustrations
and the not following the instinct, the push to doing immediately like the zen masters do
habit can both channel creativity or ingrain resistance

enjoying what you do as way to sustain it
because just pushing yourself through it is only short-term, it makes it heavier for you next time unless you process it, and if you process it, well that's good otherwise it just piles up\

perfect imperfection

growth mindset

If I'm to be completely honest I find those kinds of fears to be quite silly. I place enough trust in the Universe to know that it guides me in the right direction, esp for stuff as big as this
like, life's an adventure as soon as you take it as one
I don't see why I should waste the opportunity

I agree.  I just have some uncertainty about the whole thing, I guess.  Doubts and whatnot

here's a little-known secret: there's no certainties in life
all beliefs are incomplete
and there's no such thing as perfection that can't be improved upon
from this framework, it follows that anything you do can be iterated upon. The process is quite naturally of building upon the past; of improvement
of learning and discerning and accumulating experience and distilling wisdom
it's a bit like a physical journey. You don't go on vacation just to go to a place, otherwise it would be valid to just teleport there and back
you go there to enjoy the journey, the sights, the events, the adventure(edited)
the process
