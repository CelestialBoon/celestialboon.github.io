- guide to astral dreams and hanging in the WL (all based on the SSC) (+imagination ofc)
so basically this conflation of astral realms and imagination and dreams and OOBE and SSC and everything else as just visiting the same kind of realms, the nonphysical, which are connected to a degree (shift of vibrations) and can be accessed through much of the same ways
that are bilocation or full immersion, which basically amounts to the spectrum in which awareness of the physical (and the ordinary consciousness) is retained.
(After that, there's basically just the state of mind, and probably the state of your energy body or so but you're good to go baby)
so yeah. It's basically possible to use ways of accessing any of those to access the others. If they're super specfic you can just shift later, but the state of consciousness broadly speaking is basically the same (SSC)
and the way they are connected mostly is how the reality of the one is the myth of the other
  keep in mind the autopilot! but, well not as foundation. More like, do realize that you already have patterns of navigation of these spaces and you can access them, provide gentle guidance as you provide it to the autopilot of the body
  
 also imagination takes place in the mental, mostly, and is possibly subject to the mind noise, (kinda expected since it involves lighter trance states?) which gets tamed with meditation 

work up your awareness! Meditation, recalling exercises, etc.
Remember to work your dream recall! Very important to capture all these experiences in detail
