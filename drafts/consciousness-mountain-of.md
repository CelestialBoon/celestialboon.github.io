“The field of the Quantusum is everywhere. Its presence is the very reason that so few know anything about them.”
“Freewill?”
Uncle looked at me with eyes that signaled surprise, but he simply nodded, and brought his finger slowly to my forehead, touching the place between my eyes, just above the bridge of my nose. “Sit down comfortably—I’ll show you something.”
I sat down, unsure of what he was doing, but trusting him completely. “Close your eyes,” Uncle said. “Breathe as shallow as you can. Concentrate on slowing down your breath… imagine that you’re self-contained without any attachment to this world… even breathing the air is unnecessary…”
As I listened to his voice I began to feel my body dip into drowsiness. Somewhere inside me, I was already seeing a whole new world appear, and even Uncle’s voice bent down to this new reality.
A forest of ancient trees surrounded me. I was held tight in the thick tree trunks that bounded me. I looked behind me as I heard Uncle’s voice. “This is where many people live, in the tight constraints of a dense forest.”
“A forest… I don’t understand?” I said.
“It’s a metaphor,” Uncle chuckled. He looked noticeably younger and wore a beige- colored tunic, but his presence felt the same. Uncle raised his hand and touched my forehead. “Look now.”
I felt no movement, but I was now in a meadow with high grass rolling to the light breeze that swept across a vast plain beneath the light of a golden sun. In the far expanse I could see a beautiful mountain awash in the atmospheric haze of a blue- gray vastness.
Uncle remained at my side, and I noticed his arm was pointing to the distant mountain. “That is known in this land as the mountain of consciousness. Look around you.”
To my surprise there were other people in the field with us. Some were painting pictures of the mountain, some were composing music, and others had turned their backs and were looking to the forest behind us.
Uncle shrugged, anticipating my thoughts. “They admire the mountain, but they prefer to paint pictures of it or write melodies and poems, than to climb it.” He pointed behind us. “Those people… they don’t like the open spaces… too much vision. They feel naked out here.”
Uncle placed his finger on my forehead again. “Now look.”
We were at the base of the mountain; in the shadows of a deep valley. The mountain was enormous. I had never seen anything so magnificent… so massive. The mountain’s presence was awe-inspiring, and all I could do was crane my head and admire its soaring reaches. Its summit appeared unattainably high.
“Does anyone ever climb it?” I asked, turning to Uncle.
“Some. Some try and give up. Most never even get this close. The presence of the mountain scares them.”
“Why?”
“Don’t you feel it? The presence of its consciousness?”
I nodded my head slowly. “Yes, but I want to see more… higher.”
Uncle smiled. “It’s in your nature. When you’re at the base of something as enormous as this, you either fear it or you want to climb it and know the view at the top. What do you see now?”
I looked suspiciously at Uncle, wondering as to the nature of his question. Wasn’t it obvious? “There’s only one thing to see—the mountain.”
Uncle touched my forehead again, and again I felt no sense of movement, but an instant later we were on a thin ledge midway up the mountain.
“Beautiful views, wouldn’t you say?” Uncle asked with a rhetorical tone.
I looked up and down the mountain. The thin ledge we were on felt vulnerable. We were thousands of feet above the floor of the valley. We were in a place uninhabitable by any but the bravest of animals. I was nearly afraid to move for fear I would fall to my certain death. “It’s hard to enjoy the view when I’m afraid I might fall.”
“Exactly,” Uncle said quietly—almost a whispered construction. “When you climb the mountain of consciousness you encounter sheer cliffs like this one—tiny ledge, big view. The question is whether to look out or keep the focus on the climb. Certainly you don’t want to look down.”
“You’re saying that people who climb this mountain don’t care about those below?”
“I’m saying it’s a natural tendency. Focus on the climb, don’t look down. Feed your soul. Feed your mind. Keep moving. Learn, learn… and learn.”
“Isn’t it necessary to do that?” I said. “If I looked down all the time, caring about those in the forest, the fields… in the valley below, I’d probably fall. I’d never complete my climb. Right?”
Uncle looked at me with sudden aloofness, and pushed me. I felt my heart suddenly sink, as my body struggled to regain its balance and stay on the ledge. Then I felt another push, this one harder, and I knew I would fall. I fell in complete and utter terror, screaming as loud as my voice would go. I fell like a piece of iron seeking the firmness of earth.
A mere ten feet from meeting the grassy, blood-smeared end that burst into my imagination, I stopped and floated quietly to the ground. Uncle was already there, his arms folded across his chest.
“That’s done,” he announced.
My terror-stricken face felt permanent as I looked around my surroundings, wondering if I was really alive.
“You’re okay,” Uncle said. “You needed that.”
“I needed that?”
“Get it out of your system, and reset your mind.”
“Next time you need to reset my system, can you ask permission first?” My glaring eyes were no doubt difficult to look at, because Uncle turned away and pointed to a group of people who’d gathered to make prayers to the mountain.
“They praise and worship this mountain. They never really climb it, but they sure love to talk about it.”
“What was that about?”
“What?”
“Pushing me off a cliff?”
“You needed to experience the fear of these people. See it through their eyes.”
“This is all metaphors… can you speak plainly?”
“In this place, metaphor and reality are the same thing.”
I was perplexed. I half understood what he was saying, but the other half was like a black hole sucking the half I understood into its gravitational field. I looked at him, a scowl still in control of my face. “What is it you want me to learn?”
“I want you to see. Learning will come after.”
Uncle suddenly scooped down with his hand and brought up a closed hand. He then brought it to a glass box that stood on a pedestal I hadn’t noticed. He slid one of the box’s glass planes open and placed an insect inside. It looked like a grasshopper. “This creature lives its entire life in these fields without limitation. I just ended that.”
I watched as the grasshopper jumped inside the glass box hitting against the top and some of the sides. The grasshopper stopped as if he was stunned by the new circumstance of his environment.
“To the grasshopper,” Uncle said, “all is well. He is alive after all. He sees his normal environment all around him. He can’t see the glass. If I keep him in here for a few days he will stop his jumping and become acclimated to the dimensions of his new home. All he needs is food and water, and he can survive.”
“So you’re saying these people are acclimated to simply survive?”
Uncle slide one of the side panels of the glass box open. “If you were a grasshopper, what would you do?”
“I would jump through the open panel.”
“But how would you know it was open? It’s perfectly clear glass.”
I thought about it for a moment. “I’d jump in every direction… I’d experiment.”
Uncle took a stick and pointed it at the grasshopper through the open side panel, and the grasshopper jumped into the opposite wall, hitting his head and falling to his side. “Do you see that I offered him an exit and he fled? He could’ve climbed on the stick, and I would have freed him.”
“Yes, but he doesn’t know that.”
“True.”
Uncle opened another side panel. “What you said is right. You experiment. You try different ways to climb the mountain of consciousness. You don’t settle on one way… one method… one teacher. If you devote your entire life to the worship of one thing, what if you find out when you take your last breath that the one thing was not real.
“You find that you lived inside a cage all your life. You never tried to jump out by experimenting, by testing the walls. The people who never bother to climb this mountain are inside a cage, and they don’t know it. Fear is the glass wall. Wakan Tanka comes and opens one of the glass panels, perhaps offers a stick for them to climb out, but they jump away, going further inside their soul-draining boundaries.”
Uncle brought the stick out again and lightly jabbed it in the direction of the grasshopper, who hopped through the open side panel, and was instantly lost in the thick underbrush that surrounded us.
Uncle turned his eyes to me. “Are you ready to do the same?”
“Jump out of the cage?”
Uncle nodded.
“Why not,” I said, trying to sound brave. “This is the equivalent of your seeking my permission, isn’t it?”
Uncle walked up to me, and as he’d done before, placed his finger on my forehead. “This is the equivalent of having no equivalent.”
In a flash we were both standing high above the valley, looking down from the mountain at the curved earth below. The height was staggering. I looked up and could see the summit was just a short climb, but already the view was mesmerizing. Uncle’s final words were still echoing in my mind.
“Amazing,” I said, feeling the wind curl around the narrow summit. I knew I should be cold, but I felt comfortable. I knew the oxygen levels should be all but depleted, but I could breathe fine.
“Follow me,” Uncle said.
We walked quietly to the very top of the great mountain, hearing the winds, but nothing else. When we arrived at the very top, the panorama took my breath away. Uncle and I stood awestruck, looking out to the far horizons.
“Do you see that?” Uncle asked, pointing.
There was a sea glistening in the far horizon line. “I didn’t know there was a sea,” I said.
“Do you see that?”
I followed Uncle’s pointing arm to a city in the far distance with glass buildings that reflected the sky. “Millions of people live in that city.
“Look there.”
Again, I followed Uncle’s finger and saw another mountain range, way in the distance. None of the mountains looked as high as the one we were sitting on, but it felt good to see more.
“None of these places you knew existed until you arrived right here.” Uncle punctuated his statement by pointing down to the gray, lichen-covered rocks we stood on.
“Have you thought about the mountain?” Uncle asked.
“What do you mean?”
“Since we came upon the summit, have you thought about the mountain?”
I shook my head. “To be honest, I’ve only thought about what’s out there.” I pointed to the various sights we had just looked at.
Uncle squinted; his eyes told me his soul had been summoned elsewhere. “You climb this mountain of consciousness for the vision from its summit, but when you arrive, you no longer think about the mountain. It’s the view… the vision. You can see how everything is part of the tapestry that weaves all life forms, all matter, even time and space into a single fabric. We call that fabric by many names—those who’ve climbed this mountain, but we all see the same thing. We all experience the one force that connects all.
“Those who stay in the forests, the fields, the valleys, they like their sense of separation. They feel comfortable there. The effort to see this… requires too much adjustment. What is coming will change that. The Grand Portal will remove the sense of separation.”
He paused and looked at me, his eyes open again. “The glass box… it will become visible. People will see the box they live in, and they will jump out of it.”
“To what?”
Uncle held out his arms in an all-encompassing gesture. “The world of vision.”
I began to feel light-headed, and wondered if the oxygen levels were indeed having an effect on me. I crouched down, hoping to avert a painful collapse on the jagged rocks underfoot.
“Look here,” Uncle said.
I struggled to raise my head in his direction, and for one last time I felt his finger touch my forehead.
The next thing I remember was the smell of the cave, the relative darkness, the deep quiet, and Uncle’s hand on my shoulder. “Are you okay?”
“I think so,” I managed to say. “Where did you take me? What was that place?’
“It was a place I created from my imagination.”
“How could I be in it?”
“I invited you.”
“But how? I don’t remember your invitation.”
Uncle crouched down beside me and put his arm around my shoulder. “Let’s go outside, walk awhile, maybe get some water. We should check on Kohana, too.”
He helped me to my feet as I wobbled a bit standing up. I caught a glimpse of him in the dim light of the cave and felt such a powerful sense of his caring. Sometimes you meet people whose sense of mission is so clearly etched on their persona that you try to rise to their heights, to become entangled in their passion. I felt this entanglement, and even though I was weakened physically, another kind of strength was entering me.
